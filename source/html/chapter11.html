we’ll begin this evening’s question period.  Nature abhors a

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">Question:
 One of my lay insight meditation teachers said, “The Western lay
practitioner is an experiment in Buddhism.”  What do you think?  To
me it seems our lay teachers are also an experiment.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">LPP:
 There seems to be some bias there.  Certainly, in the West so far,
the predominant mode is lay practice and lay teachers. Although
there’s an increasing amount of interest in people wanting to study
with monastic teachers, and there’s certainly a strong interest in
monastic training, the monastic presence is still pretty tiny,
really.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">At Abhayagiri,
we almost always have a waiting list for people who want to come and
train.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">The classic
model is for the Monastic Sangha to be laying the foundation for
teaching, leadership and being an example.  I think oftentimes there
is a false dichotomy perceived, from the West, because the monastic
presence is so strong in Asia. Oftentimes, people overlook the
strength of the tradition of lay practice and lay teachers in Asia.
Certainly in Thailand, that is very much the case.  There are laymen
and women who are excellent scholars, teachers.  It’s not as
monochromatic as people perceive.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
       <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">Look at the
model that the Buddha himself gave. There’s a very interesting
discourse where Mara comes, right after the Buddha is enlightened,
and says, “You’ve done your work; it's time to pack it in.  You
can die now.”  And the Buddha says, “It is my function and
purpose to teach and I won’t pass away until the monks, nuns,
laymen, and laywomen are well established in the path and the fruits,
able to give leadership and solve problems, able to stand on their
own, so this Dhamma and Discipline can last for a long time.”  That
was the Buddha’s standard of what was a balanced, strong
dispensation: when monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen were all
knowledgeable and well-practiced.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">Question:
 This is a common scenario:  I’m caught in a story of praise and
blame.  I notice a voice says, “That was very quick.  You’re
getting good at this.”  I wake up again.  “Ah, I know you, Mara.”
 A voice says, “Excellent, what a skillful yogi you’re becoming.”
Mara seems to co-opt every moment of awakening to feed the ego.  Do I
patiently endure, and this will dissipate with time and practice, or
is there something you can suggest?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">LPP:
 Well, it’s both, in the sense that it’s really hard to
overestimate how important patient endurance is to the practice –
the willingness to bear with the pathetic nature of the mind.   But
then there are also those experiments, those reflections we use in
undermining the perceptions of self and ego – the recollection of
impermanence, uncertainty, and change. </font><font face="SimSun, 宋体">“</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">These
are mental states arising and ceasing.</font><font face="SimSun, 宋体">”</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">
That’s tuning into it as dhammas arising and ceasing, as opposed to
me struggling with Mara, me being the champion over Mara, me being
defeated by Mara again:  that “me and Mara” story.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">So, seeing
dhammas arising and ceasing, that’s all that is needed. There isn’t
a “me” in that.  It’s a really important aspect of insight to
be turning attention towards.  Also, we can develop the
deconstructing of the process of how thoughts arise and cease:
getting to know the sense of feeling, perception, mental formation,
consciousness, desire, attachment, and clinging, the process of
Dependent Origination –</font><font face="SimSun, 宋体">“</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">It’s
just these five khandhas that are arising and ceasing</font><font face="SimSun, 宋体">”</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">–
and being able to rest in the awareness of those five khandhas, as
opposed to buying into the story of “me and my khandhas.”</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">Question:
 The loving-kindness chant includes “May I abide in freedom from
affliction.”  Why is affliction not included in the wish for all
beings, while hostility, ill-will and anxiety are in both?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">LPP:
 The reason is because in that chant it’s actually just a little
bit further down.  I can’t remember how it’s translated, but that
particular chant is the chant for all the Brahma Viharas:
loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.  The
wish “May all beings be free from affliction” is an expression of
compassion and is actually worded, “May all beings be released from
all suffering.”  That is how it is expressed, because that is the
fundamental expression of compassion.  The loving-kindness aspiration
is the wish for happiness and well-being and the expression of
compassion is the wish for freedom from suffering.  For some reason,
in that chant, it is folded in with loving-kindness.  Sometimes it’s
difficult to find a hard and fast distinction between the two.  In
order to experience well-being, then of course one needs to be free
from suffering.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">Question:
 This morning you spoke about bringing to mind the metta nimitta, the
metta object.  I have some understanding of the feeling of metta, but
no understanding of the metta nimitta.  Could you explain more fully?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">LPP:
 It’s exactly the same.  Nimitta is more a generic term for the
object.  We often associate nimitta with some type of light or image.
 With mindfulness of breathing and concentration, there would be
encouragement to develop a sign of light or imagery. But the actual
word nimitta just means sign.  So the sign of metta is the feeling,
the actual feeling, emotion within the heart, within experience. 
That is the nimitta.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">It is important
to attend to that. If one is looking for something else, or just
repeating the phrases, thinking, </font><font face="SimSun, 宋体">“</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">This
is the metta nimitta,</font><font face="SimSun, 宋体">”</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">
or trying to conjure up an image of oneself being suffused with
loving-kindness somehow, one can get off track. The feeling itself is
the sign, the tangible object that is the basis for unification,
which one is able to absorb into.  As one experiences and nurtures
that, one can allow the mind to unify with the feeling, and that’s
how it expands and stabilizes.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">Question:
 Can you speak about working with fear and loss of ego identity, fear
and death?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">LPP:
 That’s one of the places where loving-kindness is a very skillful
meditation and exercise, because that sense of fear easily comes up
with the loss of the familiar, with the uncertainty of where to place
one’s attention. What can one trust as one starts to see?  Body:
can’t rely on that.  Feelings, perceptions, thoughts: completely
untrustworthy.  Consciousness: not a good deal.  You look at the
world around and…</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">So it’s easy
to be shaken by the instability and uncertainty of everything, and
there can be a fear there, uncertainty, a certain confusion and
discombobulation. It’s good to be able to recognize that, even if
our experience is completely uncertain and unstable, </font><font face="SimSun, 宋体">“</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">This
particular feeling of loving-kindness is trustworthy.  I’ve
experienced that. I’ve seen that.  That’s a true feeling within
the heart.</font><font face="SimSun, 宋体">”</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">
  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
      <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">There is also
the confidence that arises just in virtue, all the things that the
Buddha encourages.  There isn’t anything that the Buddha encourages
that is something to be looked on askance, as if it were
untrustworthy.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">On a certain
level when one first approaches the teachings, like in the morning
chanting:  Birth is dukkha, ageing is dukkha, sickness is dukkha,
death is dukkha, separation is dukkha, association is dukkha:
everything’s dukkha. One can think,  “Wow, this is a miserable
teaching.”    </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">But then when
one investigates: well, what does the Buddha actually encourage you
to do?  What does he lay out as a path of practice and training?  The
Noble Eightfold Path. Right View, Right Intention: association with
wisdom.  Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood: virtue.  Right
Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration: peaceful, tranquil
states of mind.  Well, it’s all good.  The path is completely
associated with the wholesome, the skillful, the uplifting.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">Then there are
other spiritual attributes we can trust, say, the qualities that are
conducive to passing over, transcending, crossing over suffering: the
paramis.  Generosity, virtue, renunciation, patience, effort,
resolution, truthfulness, loving-kindness, equanimity, wisdom:
everything that one could conceive of that is really good.  That’s
what the Buddha encourages and that’s what forms the basis for the
ability to cross over suffering. The heart is replete with well-being
and stability.  Recollecting and reminding oneself of what the Buddha
encourages us to cultivate and develop: those are all exceedingly
beneficial, bright states of mind.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">When aspects of
fear come up, it’s helpful to be able to recognize where they come
from.  Of course, they come from identification with self,
identification with ego, identification with body, identification
with mind, identification with the world and all the things that we
have pretty much no control over.  So when one looks at it quite
clearly, one realizes, “Well, I really have very little control.”
 It’s a very practical teaching to allow us to approach this. It’s
quite natural in the human condition to be dismayed at the loss of,
the threat to self and ego.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">There’s a
wonderful quote by Ajahn Maha Boowa, speaking about Ajahn Mun.  Ajahn
Mun once taught, “Normally, as human beings, we respond to
teachings on liberation and Nibbana with a curious sense of fear and
trepidation. I don’t want to go there. I don’t want to do that. 
There’s nothing there.  Our parents and grandparents have all
taught us quite well to attach to family, attach to possessions, and
attach to position.” That’s our conditioning.  As the
conditioning changes, inevitably there is a shift that takes place,
and I think it is important to recollect what the Buddha actually
encourages us to do.  This is good stuff.  </font>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">Question:
 I’m not sure within the context of this retreat when to be resting
simply with the four foundations of mindfulness, and when to be
reciting metta phrases.  Can you please advise as to how and when to
move skillfully from one practice to the other?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">LPP:
 Within the context of how I’ve been presenting what is “billed”
as a metta retreat, there is a recognition of how metta is a part of
a spectrum of practices that are the Buddha’s teachings.  Certainly
the four foundations of mindfulness are an overarching framework to
attend to.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">There’s a
discourse in the Majjhima Nikaya where the Buddha talks about
establishing mindfulness on particular skillful, wholesome thoughts
and being able to hold that exclusively for a day, or a night, or a
day and a night: establishing the mind in that, discerning what’s
skillful and unskillful, and then committing to the wholesome
thoughts.  But then the mind gets tired, so then it’s necessary to
return to a place of stillness or stability.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
      <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman"><span style="text-decoration: none">One
has to recognize clearly and engage skillfully in the recitation of
the metta phrases</span></font><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">.
 It’s using a thought process, and, by its very nature, it’s easy
for it to become repetitious and feel tiring to the mind.  Again,
it’s important to recognize that the recitation of those phrases is
to be used as a recollection and a reminder of the actual feeling. 
As one establishes that feeling, which is non-discursive, the mind
can stay with that.  But the recitation is a helpful tool to keep the
mind within the bounds of metta, the loving-kindness perception.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
    <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">But if one is
continuing to do that and the feeling is not strong enough to enable
one to rest in it in a non-discursive way, then it’s important to
rest the mind on an object within the four foundations of mindfulness
– body, feeling, mind, and objects of mind – in some way.  Of
course, the body is an immediate non-discursive object that the mind
can rest in, relax in, bringing a settling quality throughout the
body and mind.  When the mind is refreshed, then it can go back to
the recitation to keep developing and stabilizing the perception of
the feeling.  So, one can work with them back and forth.  There’s
no hard and fast rule. It’s more: What is the result?  What is the
state of the mind?  What is going to be useful for settling and
stilling?   </font>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">Question:
 It seems that metta would be much easier without a self to protect. 
How does one realize anatta?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">LPP:
 That’s an excellent question, in the sense that, as an insight,
one starts by realizing that the obstruction to metta is actually not
anger and ill-will, but the sense of self.  That’s the big
obstruction, and as we reflect, investigate and start having a clear
insight into the nature of Dhamma, the nature of the teachings and
what the Buddha is giving us as an opportunity for liberation, then
loving-kindness is a natural expression of that non-self aspect of
the Dhamma.  Yes, the cultivation of metta would be a lot easier
without the perception of self.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">Question:
 What is upekkha, equanimity, and how does one practice it?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">LPP:
 Upekkha is equanimity and evenness of the mind, the mind being in
perfect balance, a sense of recognition of the nature of kamma.  The
practice and basis of equanimity is traditionally described as
understanding the nature of kamma.  The chants we do say:  “All
beings are the owners of their kamma, heir to their kamma, born of
their kamma, related to their kamma, abide supported by their kamma. 
Whatever kamma they shall do, for good or for ill, of that they will
be the heir.”  The sense of equanimity is being able to recognize
that whatever anybody is experiencing is because of causes and
conditions that have been laid down.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
    <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">The stain or
</font><font face="SimSun, 宋体">“</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">near
enemy” of equanimity is indifference.  Equanimity is the ability to
be very steady and clear, and be in a place of equipoise and balance.
 One recognizes that the way things work is through causes and
conditions, and there’s not a “self” involved in it, there’s
not an individual, it’s merely collections of causes and
conditions. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">Our habit of
mind is to go to this person, that individual, that personality, our
preferences, our likes and our dislikes.  But stepping back to a
place of equanimity is being able to see these causes and conditions,
so one is not shaken by anything.  But it is important to recognize
that indifference is not equanimity.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">Also, the
Brahma Viharas are not separate, individual things, like you only
have equanimity because you’ve given up on loving-kindness,
compassion, and sympathetic joy.  Because loving-kindness and
compassion are exceedingly strong and stable, one has increased
understanding and insight, so that one is able to rest in a place of
complete stability and not be shaken by anything, because one sees
that the nature of all things is to arise through causes and
conditions.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">    
      <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">The reflection
on kamma is that all beings inherit the results of their kamma.
There’s not a personality, a “me” or “mine.” It’s not
fixed. It isn’t as if something happens and then that inevitable,
immutable state of being is going to exist forever.  Everything is in
a state of change.  Patterns and circumstances can all change.  As
one recognizes that and has a much clearer insight into the nature of
what causes and conditions are functioning, then one has an
opportunity to put attention onto the place where it is going to make
the most difference.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">LPP:
 It’s a way of classification in terms of entry into realization. 
There are four stages of realization:  Steam Entry, Once-Returner,
Non-Returner, and fully enlightened being or Arahant.  Sotapanna,
Sakadāgāmi, Anagāmi, Arahant. So there’s four.  </font>

a quality of mind that obstructs the fundamental goodness of the
mind, then it isn’t just doubt about the Buddha’s teachings. 
It’s the tendency to doubt, to waver.  Of course, when you doubt,
waver, are uncertain, then the focus will be on the teachings, but
you’ll tend to doubt everything else as well.  </font>

     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">So it’s good
to get a handle on doubt, uncertainty, wavering: how it plays itself
out in day-to-day life.  It’s really interesting to watch on a
day-to-day basis. How does it play out?  Should I have two of those
fruits or should I just have one?  It can turn into a moment where
everything stops: should I do this or should I do that; go forward or
go back?  We start to doubt everything, doubt can creep into
everything and then it manifests in the teachings as well: doubting
the teachings, doubting the practice, doubting oneself, can one do
it, can one not do it, is there any point even to doing this, </font><font face="SimSun, 宋体">“</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">I’m
not sure that I can do this.</font><font face="SimSun, 宋体">”</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">
 All of it is doubt. So, being able to recognize that it’s doubt,
and that’s all it is, one can then go forward.  </font>

     <font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">This is also a
situation where mindfulness of the body is really helpful, in the
sense that you’re never going to talk yourself into a resolution of
doubt through the mind.  You’ll never get everything figured out
enough not to doubt, if doubt is the underlying, fallback position. 
Recognize how doubt manifests as a feeling of uncertainty, a feeling
of hesitation, a feeling of discomfort around a particular decision
or action. Then, by employing mindfulness of the body, you yo</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">u</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic, Times New Roman">
can cut through that and move forward.  Sometimes it’s helpful to
make a wrong decision and do something, at least not get caught in
wavering and uncertainty, just as a part of training. That sense of
wanting to be absolutely sure that one is doing something right
before doing it paralyzes you and ties you up in knots.  So, be
willing to cut through that and move forward. One can feel in the
body that it is helpful just to move forward, to take action, and not
get caught in doubt.</font></p>
