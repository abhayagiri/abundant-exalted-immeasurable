In the palm-reader story, you mentioned that Ajahn Chah still had a
lot of anger, but that he chose not to act from it.  Does this mean
that, for example, if there was a troublesome monk, Ajahn Chah would
still experience a flare of anger but still have the wisdom to set it
aside and consider what to do with a cool head? This sounds similar
to what Ram Dass has said about his defilements: after so many years
of practice, they are more like little neurotic shmoos that he can
relate to in a relaxed way.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">What the palm reader was looking at was
fundamental temperament, karmic tendencies, the patterns that are
there. Anger was a particular tendency that Ajahn Chah had, but
through his ability to see clearly, he relinquished the tendency. The
awareness had such clarity that the mind was not drawn to the
tendency at all. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">There was a very interesting circumstance
that one of the Western monks had with Ajahn Chah. Ajahn Jayasaro,
who is an English monk, was attending to Ajahn Chah and sitting with
him, massaging his feet. A particular monk came in who had done
something wrong, had been admonished for it and was undergoing a
period of penance.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">Ajahn Chah barked at him and scolded him,
in what seemed to be a flare-up of anger. That was what was
manifested. Ajahn Jayasaro, who was there massaging his feet, said
that the peculiar thing was that there was absolutely no tension in
his body. There was no manifesting of a mood or any kind of
excitement. Ajahn Chah probably said to himself, “What this monk
needs is to be ripped down one side and up another.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">There was a similar circumstance that I had
with Ajahn Maha Boowa, who is well known for a couple of things.
First, he is considered the </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>arahant</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">
of the age in Thailand. He is in his mid-nineties now. He has been
considered to be highly attained for a long time, and he is also well
known for his ferocious tendencies. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">I remember one time going to visit and
spend some time with him. I had done a lot of practice at the time,
and my mind was very still and clear. I was watching Ajahn Maha Boowa
speaking in a ferocious way, hearing the words and seeing his
actions. But I was flooded with these feelings of joy and
loving-kindness that I felt he was actually emanating. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">You may be able to control anger, but it is
different from when anger is not there at all. Certainly you were
always quite careful around Ajahn Chah because you never knew which
side was going to come out. It wasn’t as if he was just playing
with you, but it is as if he always responded to the situation or the
person and there was no fixed way he was going to be boxed in: “Oh,
I’m supposed to be a nice loving-kindness monk.” You didn’t
want to get on the wrong side of him because he could be very direct
and blunt. </font>

Would you explain the duties adult children have towards aging
parents? And the duties of parents towards their children, as taught
by the Buddha.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">The Buddha taught that one should look
after one’s parents and try to care for their needs. In Asia, in
general, that is very much a part of the cultural norm. One looks
after one’s parents. Of course, the parents have a duty toward
their children of both helping and being role models for their
children and grandchildren. In an ideal world, that is how it works. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">The Buddha also said that the greatest gift
that one could give to their parents, and I think it would work the
same for parents towards children, is encouraging one’s parents in
virtue, generosity, and right view. There are material things that
one can give to one’s parents, and that is an excellent thing to be
doing. However, it is even more beneficial and useful if one can
encourage one’s parents to establish themselves in a higher degree
of virtue and generosity, as well as in aspects of right view and
discernment. </font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Plus">3.
In a Dhamma talk several years ago, you mentioned in an interview a
Christian monk. Reflecting on his forty years of monastic life, the
monk said something about “I wish I’d been more kind.”
Reflecting on your thirty-five years in robes, do you have any
lessons that stand out? I’m not interested in regrets, but the kind
of wisdom-knowledge that the accumulation of years of practice
illuminates. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">It would depend on whatever is the thought
of the moment as it comes out. It is also very encouraging that
people actually remember Dhamma talks. I had forgotten I said that. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">A strong lesson that pops out, picking at
random out of the hat right now, is the aspect of patience. It is
certainly something that Ajahn Chah emphasized over and over again.
For myself that is one lesson that comes to mind: just be willing to
be patient with things. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">Sometimes we don’t recognize the goodness
that we are engaged in. Often our standards and expectations are
high, and we judge ourselves in ways that reflect that expectation.
We’re not patient enough to recognize the goodness that we are
actually doing. It’s important to be present with that fundamental
goodness that is a motivating factor in all of the things we do. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">In respect to all of you who are on a
retreat here, you wouldn’t be here if you weren’t committed to
leading a wholesome, skillful life. And that commitment is often
something not reflected on. Instead we think, “I’ve got to do
this. I’ve got to do that. I’ve got to live up to this standard.
This teacher said this. That teacher said that.” It goes on and on.
</font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">So just be patient enough to set that all
aside and say, “Well, what’s really important to me?” Allow
that to come into the heart and recognize it. And again, patience
isn’t just grimly enduring; rather, it is being able to be present
with experience. That is how I relate to patience: that willingness
and ability to be present with experience, so we can take it in and
be present for it. </font>
</p>

Is it hopeless to send loving-kindness to Mara?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">Well, Mara gets a bad rap. It depends on
how we relate to it. Mara is the personification of the tempter. In
the midst of being tempted with the desire of the moment,
loving-kindness might not be the right tool. But in a bigger sense,
that is the most important thing to have loving-kindness for, in the
sense that loving-kindness is the wish for well-being. Mara is the
epitome of the tempter, the personification of evil. That’s a lot
of suffering isn’t it? The karmic accumulations don’t bode well
for him. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">When we follow our desires and get caught
in our views and opinions, how we suffer! That the whole construct
keeps repeating </font><font face="Gentium Book Basic">itself: these
</font><font face="Gentium Plus">are the forces of Mara. That’s a
worthy object of loving-kindness because there is so much suffering
there. This helps turn our attention to the way out of suffering. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Plus">5.
When you have guided meditation in the past two afternoons, I’ve
enjoyed slipping past the rapture and joy. I found the meditations
incredibly grounding and at the same time streaming with energy. I’m
finding it difficult to get past joy without your vocal guidance. Can
you offer suggestions? </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">It’s an experiential memory. It’s good
to remember that it’s possible to go past that excitement of
rapture and joy and be grounded in something that is very stilling,
but still clear and spacious. So, tune in to the body because the
body remembers these things. Come into the body, into the rhythm of
the breath, the feelings and perceptions of joy, but allow oneself to
move into steadiness and clarity. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">Try to connect with it on a physical level,
that is, with the tendency for energy, rapture, and joy. There can be
a level of excitement that bubbles up. When we give an image to what
joy does, it bubbles up. So move the energy down and through the
body, allowing it to settle. That’s a skillful way to work with it
because once it comes up, it can feed into the proliferating mind.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">It’s the suffering: that’s how we learn
to drop it and recognize the limitations, drawbacks, and pain
involved. Certainly, personalities are conditioned by all that: past
</font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>kamma</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">,
present </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>kamma</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">,
family </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>kamma</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">,
cultural </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>kamma</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">,
nationality, gender, everything. It’s all part of the conditioning
process. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">But then recognize its impermanence,
instability, and changing nature. Because what we call our
personality sometimes manifests like this, sometimes like that,
depending on the people we are with and circumstance we are in. It
isn’t as if it’s fixed and immutable. It picks and chooses. So
learn how to recognize that, by seeing that changing, impermanent,
uncertain nature. What we take as mine and me—it’s not fixed at
all. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus"><span style="font-style: normal">Anicca</span></font><font face="Gentium Plus">
is often translated as “impermanent or changing.” Ajahn Chah
would tend to translate the word </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><span style="font-style: normal">anicca</span></font><font face="Gentium Plus">
as “uncertain or “not sure.” I think that is an important
shift. What is impermanent or changing tends to be objectified,
whereas “uncertain” is much more subjectified: how I feel; how I
experience things. It’s an important shift. Bring it back into the
subjective field of “how do I experience what I think of as moods,
feelings, impressions, thoughts, or personality?” So one is seeing
the suffering involved that inevitably comes up with those
perceptions—the burden that I was talking about this morning, the
limitation of being a dog tied to a post. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">Also, it is important that we don’t take
it too seriously, that we are able to laugh at ourselves and the
human condition, because taking it all very seriously weighs us down.
In the end it is absurd. Life is sometimes “How did I walk into
this Samuel Beckett play?” </font>

Just to clarify for my loving-kindness anxiety, are any phrases okay?
And can they be said as a chant or at any speed? Is one more
effective for attaining deep concentration?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">The phrases have to have some sort of
feeling meaningful to you. Is it meaningful to you? Does it resonate
somehow? Because what is really important is not so much the phrases,
but the feeling that arises, the feeling that is generated and
established within the heart, loving-kindness. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">As you cultivate meditation as a practice,
it’s helpful to have a few techniques, methods, phrases, and chants
that feel comfortable to you because the nature of the mind is to get
inured to whatever you are doing. No matter how good it is, you are
going to get familiarized, and it is going to lose its potency,
whether quickly or slowly. It’s the nature of the mind. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">Have a few tools. It’s like when you have
a tradesman show up at your house. You want an electrician to do
something and he walks in with no tools or just one screwdriver. You
are not going to feel confident that the job is going to get done.
It’s the same here. As we are practicing and cultivating, have some
tools on your belt. </font>

Sometimes when I am concentrated, I have spontaneous body or facial
movements. They may be large or just small twitches. Can you comment
on this?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">It’s reasonably common. This is when an
attunement with the body is quite helpful, and loving-kindness is
very good with balancing that kind of energy within the body-mind
complex, allowing that to unravel and untie. Whereas trying to
concentrate too strongly or forcing the mind to have mindfulness
tends to exacerbate things. So mindfulness practice that is broad and
body-based lets that kind of energy flow through the body-mind. Then
loving-kindness has a subsidiary effect of softening, replacing, and
settling. These are good practices to work with. </font>

Is gladness the same as thankfulness?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">In the chant in which the word is
translated as gladness, the Pali word is </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>mudita</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">,
which is appreciative joy, sympathetic joy, delighting in the
goodness and succes</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">s<!-- I tentatively left it in italics since it was last glossed Talk 3 evening. - H --></font><font face="Gentium Plus">
of others. So that’s not quite the same as thankfulness. Another
Pali word that is sometimes translated as gladness is </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>p</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>ām</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>ojja</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">.
That’s a feeling of well-being, a kind of delight, a sense of
feeling good about something. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">Often the causal conditions in these
sequences are a bit different: reflecting on virtue and the sense of
non-remorse, a feeling of gladness arises. Reflecting on the truth of
the teachings, gladness arises, or faith or confidence. Thankfulness
is more gratitude, which in Pali is </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>kataññut</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>a</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>.</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">
That feeling of thankfulness, appreciation, and gratitude has a
different quality to it. So the word gladness is used in a couple of
different ways. </font>

The near enemy of equanimity is aloofness. I’ve tasted both. One is
much more familiar, and the difference is quite apparent. Can you
provide any clues to identify subtle aloofness, which may not be so

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">One of the things that immediately comes
up—I’ve mentioned it several times and then it also came up in
the reading of the </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>Kalama

if this is wholesome or unwholesome? Is it beneficial or not
beneficial? So there is an immediate turning to what is </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>kusala</i></font><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt"><!-- I left this in italics since it is reglossed below. --></font><font face="Gentium Plus">.

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">The near enemy of equanimity is aloofness
or indifference. Indifference will always have a certain negativity,
dullness, or slight aversion. It’s sort of: “I don’t want to
deal with this, get out of my face.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">

will be </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>kusala</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">:
wholesome and associated with a sense of well-being, clarity, and
presence. There is equanimity in the sense of being balanced, but it
isn’t a shutting out or holding at bay. There doesn’t need to be.
With equanimity we can be completely present with whatever is there
because it isn’t intimidating. It’s not something that is
fearful. It’s not even strange. It’s just the way it is. </font>

In your opinion, why do you think that Venerable Moggallana is most
often portrayed in suttas as a bit of an idiot and highly impractical
while Venerable Sariputta is portrayed as wise and skillful? Both
were the Buddha’s leading disciples. Is this possibly a result of
translation or translators’ view, or is this so in Pali also?</font></p>

<font face="Gentium Plus">Actually, I think if anybody gets the short
end of the stick, it is Ananda, because he is a bit of a fall guy
sometimes. But with all of his psychic powers, there is a certain
spectacular quality to Moggallana. He is also sometimes involved in
sorting out certain problems within the sangha. He is trusted, as

<font face="Gentium Plus">I’m not so familiar with the Mahayana
sutras. Certainly Sariputta is often a fall guy in the Mahayana
sutras. I’m not sure how Moggallana comes across in the Mahayana
sutras. </font>

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">In regards to Anuruddha, there is a passing
comment about when Ananda had asked Anuruddha to sort something out
and it didn’t get done (A 4:243). The Buddha says, “Why did you
even ask Anuruddha? You know what he’s like. He’s just not
interested in practical matters.” It wasn’t a criticism. He was
just the wrong person for the job.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">I think one of the things is that in the
Pali Canon, these great disciples come across as very human. They
have personalities. They are distinct individuals. </font>

<font face="Gentium Plus">There is a great sutta in which Sariputta
is sitting and meditating in the forest and Moggallana, who is adept
in psychic powers, sees this scene unfolding where there are two
</font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>yakkhas</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">,
which is a type of celestial demon. They are flying along overhead
and see Sariputta meditating in the forest. It is the day before the
Full Moon Day, and monks have nicely shaved heads. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">One of the </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><span style="font-style: normal">yakkhas</span></font><font face="Gentium Plus">
says, “Look at that nicely shaved head. I’d just love to take my
club and wallop it.” And the other </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><span style="font-style: normal">yakkha</span></font><font face="Gentium Plus">
says, “I wouldn’t do that if I were you. These sons of the
Sakyan, they are pretty special sometimes. Be careful.” The other
says, “I don’t know—that’s a great target. I don’t think I
can resist.” So he goes over, takes his club, and wallops Sariputta
over the head. The description is that he gives him a blow that could
split a mountain. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">Sariputta is unmoved. Moggallana has seen
this scene unfold. Sariputta comes out of his meditation, and
Moggallana asks, “How are you feeling today?” Sariputta says,
“Okay. But I’ve got a bit of a headache today.” Moggallana
says, “It’s no wonder, with these </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><span style="font-style: normal">yakkhas</span></font><font face="Gentium Plus">.”
He relates the scene. “This is wonderful. These mighty </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><span style="font-style: normal">yakkhas</span></font><font face="Gentium Plus">
can give a blow to Sariputta, and all he says is, “I’ve got a bit
of a headache.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">Then Sariputta says, “What’s really
amazing to me is that you can see these things happening. I didn’t
see so much as a mud sprite, let alone a </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><span style="font-style: normal">yakkha</span></font><font face="Gentium Plus">,
a </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><span style="font-style: normal">deva</span></font><font face="Gentium Plus">,
or anything like that.” The sutta ends with these two great
disciples admiring each other’s qualities. </font>

What are the primary distinctions between Theravada, Mahayana, and
Vajrayana? </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">Without confusing people, I think
Theravada, just by the very literal translation of its name, means
the teaching of the elders. Its primary focus is in trying to
maintain the tradition as it was passed down as closely as they could
assume were the original teachings of the Buddha. There are always
some accretions and additions, but that has been its primary flavor. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">It’s also interesting that when the Dalai
Lama gives teachings, one of the things he will do is invite
Mahayana, Theravada, and Vajrayana monks to give blessings before the
teachings begin. He will always invite the Theravadans to give a Pali
chant because he will say that the oldest scriptures are in Pali, and
these are the elder brothers within the Buddhist fold. He gives
deference. It is very beautiful. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">In Buddhist history, there was a range of
schools. About 250 years after the Buddha, by the time of King Asoka,
there were about eighteen distinct schools of Buddhism. Subsequent to
that, there began to be a Mahayana movement, reinvigorating and
redefining some of the principles. One of the main principles is
putting emphasis on the Bodhisattva ideal.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">The Vajrayana grew out of the Mahayana.
There are several Vajrayana schools. Usually when someone says
Vajrayana, they mean Tibetan. The Vajrayana schools in Tibet actually
took many of the different schools and brought them to Tibet. One of
the distinctive qualities of the Vajrayana is the emphasis on faith,
ceremony, ritual, and the efficacy and use of that. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">These are just snapshots. Of course, within
these there are a huge number of schools as well. When you look at
Buddhism, there is not a Theravada tradition, a Mahayana tradition,
and a Vajrayana tradition that are each homogenous and monolithic. A
country like Thailand is considered very strictly Theravada. But if
you start looking and digging into the history of doctrinal and
popular Buddhism, one thing looks like a Mahayana teaching and then
another one looks like a tantric ritual. So there has been mixing and
cross-pollination going on for millennia.</font></p>

What could American culture learn from Thai culture?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">What immediately comes to mind is one of
the first things you learn when you go to Thailand. There is a
phrase, </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>“mai pen rai.”</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">
That would be a really good thing for American culture to learn. It
means “never mind,” as in, “let go, it’s not a big deal.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Plus"><i>Mai pen rai.”</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">
Literally it means, “It is not anything.” It allows people to
navigate the thorny aspects of human relationships. </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>“Mai
pen rai.” </i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">That’s the way it
is. Never mind. There is no point in getting upset. </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>“Mai
pen rai.”</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus"> </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">Of course, Thailand has been steeped in
Buddhist culture for a long, long time. There is a book that was
written by Phra Payutto; I don’t think it has ever been translated
into English. He had spent a few years in America as a visiting
scholar at Harvard University and Swarthmore College</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt"><font face="Gentium Plus"><span style="background: transparent">
</span></font></font><font face="Gentium Plus">and his English is
very good. The book he wrote is </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><span style="background: transparent">about</span></font><font face="Gentium Plus">
Thailand viewing America and America viewing Thailand—the
interchange, the things each could learn, just seeing the
possibilities. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">That’s one of the things for myself,
having grown up in North American culture and having lived in
Thailand for twenty-three years in a rural environment without
speaking English and so being able to be steeped in a different
culture. It was very helpful in being able to step back from my
cultural conditioning. It isn’t as if there is a perfect culture
anywhere. The human condition is just not that way. You think, “Wow,
if there was a culture that was steeped in Buddhism that would solve
all the problems of the world.” No, it wouldn’t. There are human
beings there. They’ll create suffering wherever they go. </font>
