<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Basic">Q:
For me, there appears to be a fine line between paying attention to
breath and controlling breath. Is it like with quantum physics: just
being aware changes the phenomena?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Basic">LPP:
That’s </font><font face="Gentium Book Basic">absolutely true in
the sense that, as we’re attentive to the breath, in the same way
as if we’re really aware of a thought or an emotion, a change is
already set in motion.</font><font face="Gentium Basic"> It takes a
degree of skill in crafting exactly how we are attentive. Sometimes
we pay attention in a way in which we have a very fixed idea of what
we want. We then of course set ourselves up to confirm that idea. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">It’s also true that we can pay attention
to the breath with an idea that we would like to become peaceful, but
there needs to be a certain letting go, a willingness not to have the
“doer” get involved and try to make things be how we conceive of
them. That sense of doing turns into busyness, tightness, and
disappointment, or it turns into gratification: we get what we want,
but then we realize that what we wanted doesn’t fit in with what we
would want if </font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><span style="display: none">
</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">we could get it. We tie
ourselves in knots that way. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">So we need to direct attention to what is
useful at this time. Is it useful to bring up a pleasing object? Is
it useful to put forth a certain determination, digging our heels in
and saying, “I’ve got to hold the line here”? Or is it
recognizing, “I’ve really got to let go into spaciousness”? </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">So, there is attention, and the breath is
the anchor that we can use to sustain and cultivate awareness and
mindfulness. But once we get into controlling the breath or trying to
control what we are getting out of it too much, we are going to feel
tension, tightness, and frustration. There is a fine line and that
comes through experience. Of course, suffering is a great teacher.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Basic">Q:
What happens when someone carefully builds a fire, but it suddenly
turns into a forest fire, uncontrollable, and the person experiences
mania, delusions, and paranoia? What is the spiritual treatment for
this?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Basic">LPP:
One of the first spiritual treatments is to stop meditating. When
there isn’t a very solid anchor in what is real, when one is caught
up in delusions, then it’s important not to feed the desire to
meditate or delight in those delusions, manic states, or paranoia. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">That doesn’t mean there is no spiritual
treatment for such delusions because I think some of the most
spiritual healing work that can be done is around keeping precepts,
associating with people who are virtuous, and drawing close to
teachings and good teachers. It’s very grounding. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Also, there are all of the aspects of
generosity, giving, and service. These are extremely positive
qualities that nurture a sense of stability and feeling good about
ourselves. Often, people go into manic states, delusions, and
paranoia because they don’t feel so good about themselves. They
want to become something else and they do it through meditation. Then
they push the mind to distance themselves from how they perceive
themselves to be, trying to become something else. We so-called
normal people also do that. We need to be attentive. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">As a young monk and then as a young abbot,
I thought meditation was a panacea, a remedy for everything.
Experience has shown me that it’s not. It is helpful to have
pharmaceuticals around sometimes. When I was in Thailand, there was a
stretch of quite a few years, my middle years as a monk when I first
became the abbot of Wat Nanachat, when, at least once or twice a

there would be somebody who would flip out. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Part of this is just being in a different
culture. There is an actual type of psychosis that is generated by
the disorientation of being in a different culture. Being in a
different culture, in a monastery, and practicing . . . suffice it to
say that in the early days of people getting interested in Buddhism
in Asia, there were some pretty wild and wooly characters out there.
A lot of them were my friends in the monastery. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">In Thailand, a traditional society, when
somebody in a monastery goes a bit off, the teacher would usually put
them to work, get them into their bodies. They would work in the
context of being surrounded by and connecting with people with good
virtue and generosity. Don’t send them off to meditate. Get them a
shovel and get them working. It’s really helpful.</font></p>

I think I mentioned today that the Pāli word is kusala: wholesome,

and at ease, is well-being, </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>sukha</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">.
There is a sense of peace and stability, and then there is a freedom
from greed, hatred, and delusion, a certain purity or a lack of the
stain of the different defilements. The opposite of this is </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>akusala.
</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">With </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>akusala</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,
there is a sense of dukkha: dissatisfaction, suffering, disease in

certain amount of restlessness or agitation, the inability to settle
and be peaceful because of the presence of the fundamental roots of

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Basic">Q:
If someone </font><font face="Gentium Book Basic">were </font><font face="Gentium Basic">to
become a monastic at Abhayagiri, how would he go about doing so? What
are the day-to-day activities of a monk? What are a monk’s duties
and responsibilities? How does this change from season to season and
year to year? What do I need to know and consider before making such
a commitment? </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Basic">LPP:
You have to know it’s not fun. Generally, what would happen would
be somebody would come to the monastery interested in practicing,
training, and becoming a monastic, and he would stay a few months. He
comes for an initial stay of a week, and then he comes back again and
asks to stay longer. If he fits in with the community, he could be
accepted to stay for a longer period of time. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">He would be in the monastery for three or
four months and then request the anagarika training, like Louis here,
who is in white. He formally takes the eight precep</font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Gentium Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">ts</font></font></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
and makes a commitment for a year. He can leave at any time, but we
encourage people to make that commitment. After someone has been
there a few months, it’s not that difficult to say, “Yes, I’d
like to stay for a year.” But we don’t have people sign contracts
or anything.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; background: transparent; line-height: 150%"><a name="__DdeLink__112_852111337"></a>
<font face="Gentium Basic">Then, as it’s coming close to a year,
assuming he wants to go further with training, he would request to
take novice ordination, which is the </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="background: transparent">ten
precepts</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic"> and brown robes.
Samanera Kaccāna is a novice. It’s the ten precepts, which are a
little bit different. One does not handle money. That changes one’s
life. When someone goes into brown, we try to distance him from the
kitchen more and also, no driving. Of course, Samanera Kaccāna
couldn’t drive anyway, for different reasons! Louis doesn’t drive
either, but again, for different reasons. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Similarly, in about a year, if somebody
wants to go forward, then he could take the full monk’s ordination
and make a commitment to stay five years with the teacher. The
decisions are community based, so he could be an anagarika or a
novice longer, but it’s approximately a year for each stage. This
doesn’t mean he would stay all of the time at the monastery because
usually we’ll send monks to study somewhere else for at least one
year during that time. Like Tan Sampajano: he is finishing his third
year here and, at the end of this Rains Retreat period, he’ll go to
study in Thailand for a year. </font>

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">As for day-to-day activities, as a general
rule, we begin at 5 o’clock in the morning, with chanting and
meditation. Then there is a short period of chores and then at 7
o’clock, a light breakfast, coffee, and tea. At 7:30 there is a
community meeting during which we divide up the work for the day. We
tend to keep the work period to just the morning. Some people could
be going off to do some construction, while some people could be
going up to work in the forest—trail work, office work, any number
of the things involved in running a monastery. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Everyone comes back together at 11 o’clock
for the main meal. We have our meal together, clean up, and then
people can go back to their dwelling places, which are individual
huts scattered through the forest. People practice on their own in
the afternoon. Some may come down for tea at 5:30, some will stay up
in the forest. Then we have the evening meeting at 7:30. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Right now, in the summertime, we’re
having our morning and evening meetings on the meditation platform in
the forest. It doesn’t have a roof, so once it starts to get too
cold or wet, then we have meetings down below, where we have a small
meeting hall. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Different monks will have different duties
and responsibilities. The whole monastery is run by the resident
community, so you have to take responsibility for looking after
things, the day-to-day maintenance, cleaning, building new things.
You learn some skills as well as learn how to sew your robes. </font>

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Samanera Kaccāna is getting ready for his
monk’s ordination, so he is deeply immersed in sewing his robes.
His ordination is October 26, and his parents were here on the
retreat. Unfortunately, his father was ill and had to leave. He
recently had an operation and it wasn’t working, so they had to
leave. They were disappointed. They were the ones who introduced
Samanera Kaccāna to Buddhism. Anybody can come to the monastery.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Basic">LPP:
Again, I think that it’s important that we are attending to the
experience of non-ill will, “not dwelling in aversion.” That is a
much more stable or steady indicator of the building of
loving-kindness—ill will, aversion, and irritation are not
overwhelming the mind. We aren’t dwelling on it; we are able to let
it go; we are able to recognize its bane. </font>

is appreciative joy, sympathetic joy, delighting in the well-being or
success of others. Its direct opposite, of course, is jealousy,
comparing oneself to others and generating negative feelings on

<font face="Gentium Basic">It’s not that easy to experience a sense

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Generally, our happiness is dependent on
our own success: getting what we want, experiencing something
pleasurable that we like. So it’s more focused around “me.” In
contrast, mudita encompasses everybody, and if our happiness is able
to be generated by somebody else’s goodness or delight and there
are another eight billion people on the planet, our chances go up
tremendously. If you’re a betting person, I would put my bets on
that.</font></p>

We are always trying to find language to encapsulate something.
Contention is based in aversion, a sense of competition, and is
generated through a sense of dislike. There is a certain ill will
there. When somebody is contentious, it’s usually fraught with
aversion or irritation. So non-contention is where we aren’t
approaching the world, other people, or our internal mental states
from a base of aversion, fear, or manipulation. It’s more an
attitude of: “This is the way it is. I don’t have to contend with
it. I don’t have to manipulate it. I don’t have to force it to be
anything else. It can just be what it is.” That is the underlying
quality of non-contention. We can just let things be as they are,
which isn’t so easy.</font></p>

Would you talk more about working with the hindrance of doubt?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Basic">LPP:
One of the things with doubt is recognizing the tendency to
uncertainty and wavering that comes when there is doubt in the mind.
There is uncertainty, wavering, not being sure. Then how do we fill
that gap? We tend either to fill it with projections of fear and
aversion or with some distraction, such as eating: “Just give me
something to eat, so I don’t have to deal with this doubt.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">This is when mindfulness of the body is
really helpful. Tuning in to and recognizing the actual feeling, that
vibration of doubt and uncertainty that comes into the mind and body
and then impels us towards some way of covering up that doubt. Doubt
is a miserable state to be with, so we want to ameliorate it in some
way. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Recognizing and being able to relax around
the doubt: this is when the body is really helpful. We can start to
relax around that doubt and uncertainty, release the tightness and
tension that is impelling us to move into something just to get out
of the doubt. Start to tune in to: “How does it make my heart,
mind, and body feel? What do I actually feel when there’s doubt?”
</font>

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">

we hold back. To be able to step into it and not be paralyzed or
overwhelmed—not reacting blindly—enables us to get out of that
feeling of doubt and uncertainty. So these are some skillful ways of
working with doubt. What needs to be recognized and brought out into
the light of awareness is: “This is doubt.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">One of the images that the Buddha gives
for the hindrance of doubt is a dish of muddy water that is then
placed in a dark cupboard. The murky quality of the water is not
seen, not clearly understood, and not recognized, so it is put in the
cupboard and hidden away. The first thing we need to do is to bring
it out into the light of awareness and say: “This is doubt; this is
unclear to me. I’m uncertain about this. I don’t know.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">It’s interesting to pay attention to how
many times in a conversation, when somebody asks you something and
you give an answer, you respond not because you actually know the
answer, but because you don’t want anybody else to recognize that
you don’t know. You try to prop up the illusion of certainty. So,
when somebody asks you something, it’s a huge breakthrough to have
the confidence to say, “I don’t really know,” rather than
think, “I’d better say something quickly or they’re going to
think that I’m dumb.” Just say, “Well, I don’t know.” It’s
actually quite easy, but it’s amazing to watch the mind over and
over again propping up the illusion of certainty, when in truth
you’re doubtful about what something is. These are some
perspectives on doubt.</font></p>

I have an ongoing problem with certain vibrations. Here the most
problematic is the recording device. The trunk of my body feels like
it is vibrating as it moves into the room, just like the hum of the

When I get some concentration and I can see the fear, doubt, and
thoughts that arise, I sometimes meet them skillfully; at other
times, I lose skillful means. Any suggestions would most gratefully
be received.</font></p>

One approach would be tuning in to the body itself, recognizing that
we can influence the feelings around us, particularly internally, if
something is agitating. We can pay attention to something like the
breath or the feeling somewhere in the body—picking a spot that
feels comfortable, bringing our attention to a place that feels at
ease. </font>

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">It’s easy for the mind to hone in on
something that we are irritated by or feel uncomfortable with. That
is what grabs attention. But the conscious directing of attention to
something that is more soothing and comfortable is a necessary part
of living a human life because we are constantly surrounded by things
that we like or dislike, that are pleasant or unpleasant, that are
agreeable or disagreeable. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">If the mind drifts into and hones into the
disagreeable, the unpleasant, the things that we dislike, then we
keep spinning around that. Certainly the definition of
loving-kindness that I’ve used on several occasions, dwelling in
non-aversion, is really a helpful tool. The mettā practice, that
dwelling in non-aversion, is a helpful base because of the nature of
the world. </font>

happiness and suffering, and gain and loss. These are basic things
that are going on all the time. It’s easy to be drawn into or be
fearful of say, criticism: to be elated when we get a bit of praise
and to try to manipulate conditions so that there is more praise and
less criticism, more gain and less loss. It’s natural, but it’s
also energy intensive. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t.

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic">It’s much more helpful, from a
perspective of practice, to see that there is that which is pleasant
and unpleasant, success and failure, whether it is material, worldly,
or in spiritual practice. Allow that to take place and allow it to be
there without being drawn into the things that generate the
unskillful tendencies or that tend to create more agitation and
suffering in the mind. </font>

<font face="Gentium Book Basic">As a young monk watching Ajahn Chah,
it was tremendously inspiring. It was as if he was this peaceful,
happy presence in the center of the universe. Things happened around
him all the time. People praised him, people criticized him, many
people were drawn to him. Monks would ordain out of inspiration,
monks would leave out of frustration and disillusionment, and Ajahn
Chah was always happy, regardless. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic">You realize that that is really
possible in the human condition. You don’t need to have conditions
that are always perfect. Ajahn Chah really didn’t have a life of
his own. He was just there for people. He wasn’t looking to have
anything special for himself. The nature of the world is such that
there are always things that jar or grate as well as things that are
pleasant. We obviously don’t go around trying to find the things
that are jarring and grating just to test ourselves or make ourselves
strong. We have enough of that in ordinary circumstances. So it’s
more of how to work with letting go, with loving-kindness. These are
the tools.</font></p>

Would you be willing to repeat the mettā phrases that you taught us
yesterday and today? The only one I can remember is, “May I be
prosperous.” </font>

 Those filters are working all the time. One is, “May I be well,
happy, peaceful, and prosperous. May no harm come to me. May no
difficulties come to me. May no problems come to me. May I always
meet with spiritual success. May I have the patience, courage,
understanding, and determination to meet and overcome inevitable
difficulties, problems, and failures in life.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic">These are the phrases. It’s helpful
to get these fully embedded in memory, so you’re not thinking,
“What the heck was that phrase that he was saying?” Committing it
to memory turns it into a kind of mantra that you can use. This is
what is called parikamma in Pāli, a repetition that is useful for
establishing concentration or consistent mindfulness. These mettā
phrases are skillful tools for setting a tone within the mind.</font></p>
