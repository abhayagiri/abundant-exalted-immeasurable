want to attend to things that stir up the quality of aversion and ill
will?” By consciously attending to those things that we perceive as
conducive to well-being and supporting the wish of well-being, there
is a strength of intention that forms in the mind, and we are able to
sustain that flow of well-wishing. </font></font>

reality, if we wanted to catalog all the things that we are offended
and feel disgruntled by, the list could start growing. But there is a
conscious choice not to give it that attention. In recognizing the
benefits of mettā, the physical and mental sense of ease that we
experience, we encourage ourselves to direct our attention to that
which is conducive to the welling up within consciousness of thoughts
and feelings of loving-kindness. </font></font>

<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
conscious cultivation of loving-kindness is a skillful way of
directing attention. As we do that, it acts almost as a solvent to
dissolve and wash away niggling thoughts and moods of aversion and
ill will. That has a certain power within consciousness because when
we see things in the light of aversion, ill will, and irritation,
then everything is an intrusion</font></font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">

<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">One
of the images that the Buddha uses describing the hindrances is
water. When water is left to its own devices, it is clean, pure,
cool, satisfying, and refreshing. We can see through it clearly. But
the image he gives when he compares it to the hindrance of ill will
and aversion is boiling water. It</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">’</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">s

see our reflection in it, or see through it clearly. If it bubbles
out of the pan and splashes on us, it burns us. Aversion and ill will
have that same quality. </font></font>

<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">As
we settle the mind down, bring the mind back to its natural state
without adding aversion and ill will, and cool it with the
development of mettā, then it returns to a clear, limpid state. It
is refreshing to look at, to wash with, and to drink. You can do
anything you want with it when the mind is brought to that state. </font></font>

<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Recollecting
the life of the Buddha as an example of loving-kindness, there are
incidents in which he relied on its application and it had a powerful
effect. One is the story, toward the end of his life, of his cousin
Devadatta, who was also a monk but was very covetous of the Buddha’s
position and wanted to take over. The Buddha didn</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">’</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">t
give him much encouragement, and Devadatta developed a grudge against
the Buddha and plotted to kill him. </font></font>

<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">One
way he did that was to bribe the king</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">’</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">s
men who were the keepers of Nalagiri, the state elephant but also a
rogue elephant, whose job description was that of executioner. They
plied him with alcohol and let him loose as the Buddha was
approaching, so that this enraged elephant would trample the Buddha.
Ananda, the Buddha</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">’</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">s
trustworthy attendant, saw the elephant coming and jumped in front of
the Buddha, wanting to protect him. The Buddha asked him to step
aside and then radiated loving-kindness. As the story goes, the
elephant came barreling up to the Buddha but then stopped in his
tracks, quite close to the Buddha, affected with that power of
loving-kindness. It then bowed and used his trunk to gather some dust
from the Buddha’s feet and put it on his own head.

it’s still a meaningful story.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Rarely
are we faced with raging elephants coming towards us, but the Buddha
chose to exercise his trust in the power of loving-kindness. I think,
in having contact with day-to-day circumstances, it is very helpful
to bring up such images: “If the Buddha can rely in such extreme
circumstances on loving-kindness, why don</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">’</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">t
I give it a try in this circumstance and see what happens?”
Generally, you will find that it works. Something changes. It is part
of the natural order: all beings respond to loving-kindness. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
remember one instance when I was still living in Thailand. I was
fairly young in my role as an abbot and was having a conflict with a
few of the monks. There was a constant feeling of agitation and
wondering why these “idiots” didn</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">’</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">t
comply with my rightness, which was obvious to me. After some time
using that method and not being very successful, I thought I’d give
loving-kindness a try. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A
small group of monks had banded together and was creating a lot of
division throughout the community. I decided to start going on a
longer alms round, close to an hour and a half, which was the route
that they had been going on. The whole period is in silence. Every
morning, just before dawn, you walk through the countryside and
villages and return to the monastery.   </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">So,
I would begin the day going on alms round with them, taking the whole
time to visualize, generate, and spread loving-kindness to them. I
tried to hold it as clearly as I could throughout the day, but I
would make it a particularly strong focus during alms round. It was
really interesting. About the third day, those monks started coming
to me. Whereas before, communication had completely shut down, they
came, we communicated, and it all opened up from there. We were able
to discuss and figure out where we had gone off track. It was
resolved within just a few days. I found it quite astounding and
inspiring.  </font></font>

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If
you really set your mind to loving-kindness, it has a transformative
effect. Of course, the major effect was on myself, not holding to
fixed views. That helps a lot. It seems pretty mundane, not as
spectacular as stories of the Buddha. If you have experimented with
loving-kindness, you will find that you have a story or know somebody
who has a story about how it has really worked. If we take the time
to cultivate and use it, there will be some kind of effect. This is
quite natural. The sense of loving-kindness is a universal quality
that we as human beings all respond to.  </font></font>

like to introduce another formulation of loving-kindness meditation,
based on the one we chanted this morning: “I will abide pervading
one quarter with a mind. . .” The chanting book says “heart,”
but it is usually translated as “mind.” For me, it seems to chant
a bit more nicely with “mind.”  </font></font>

one quarter. . .”—this is directional in the sense that it is
conceived of in terms of the directions, the four quarters—“with

third, likewise the fourth; so above and below and around and

directions—north, south, east, west, above and below, all around—so

all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness”—throughout the extension of the world and

exalted, and immeasurable quality.</font></font></p>

“<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Without
hostility and without ill will”: this is the encouragement. Without
any hostility, without allowing ill will, is the key to sending or
shining forth loving-kindness, as in the introduction to the chant,
“Now let us make the four boundless qualities shine forth.” We
allow the heart and mind to be established in those sublime
qualities. Allow it to shine forth, not obstructing it with aversion,
ill will, worry, or fear, all the tendencies that we can add to it. </font></font>

we do this, we allow the heart to feel abundant, exultant, and
immeasurable. We see that these qualities are truly beautiful. When
we think of physical beauty in the world, it doesn’t compare to the
beauty of a sublime quality like loving-kindness. It’s an image the
Buddha uses. In comparison with the stars, there isn</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">’</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">t

or think about it. This is a feeling exercise. Allow that sense of
pervading space with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, whatever it
is and however you have conceived of it, five or ten feet around you.

the feeling to whatever feels comfortable. We are in a valley, so
pervade the valley with loving-kindness, sitting here. What’s in
front? All the people, all the beings, whether they are human beings,
people in our group, people that are residents here; the animals that
are here; the beings that are non-material, any earth devas, any
other beings that are here. Extend loving-kindness, including all

is the sense that all beings are worthy of our loving-kindness. All
beings appreciate it. When we meet somebody who gives us a gesture of
kindness, it’s always appreciated. It’s natural. So we sit and
generate, spread, suffuse, and pervade the space around the four
quarters, above and below, around and everywhere. Allow that to
become brighter and brighter. </font></font>

<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Do
not allow yourself to be held back by feelings of limitation. We
limit ourselves with our perception of being unable, unworthy, or not
good enough. We realize that is not necessary. With loving-kindness,
it really doesn’t apply. It’s such a universal quality; allow
that to pervade. “I will abide pervading the all-encompassing world
with a mind imbued with loving kindness; abundant, exalted,
immeasurable, without hostility, and without ill will.” </font></font>

<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Recognize
that even if it is just a niggling bit of ill will, a flash of
negativity, it’s a limitation of the heart that can be set aside
and dropped. We can allow that feeling of loving-kindness to expand.
We can continue working with it; we can experiment. Allow the feeling
of loving-kindness to extend further out, to more and more beings,
not making any distinction, not dividing the world up into us and
them or me and others. Recognize that the heart of loving-kindness
doesn’t make those distinctions. That is its fundamental quality.
That is what gives it its strength, when we’re able not to get
bogged down in those distinctions. As we make those distinctions—me
and others, us and them—that limitation and feeling of constriction
is immediately felt. </font></font>

you feel the suffusion of loving-kindness collapsing, just start back
again. Direct loving-kindness to yourself: “And to all as to
myself.” Attend to those thoughts of loving-kindness directed to
yourself. That is the seed, the core, the base that we work from. </font></font>

<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">There
is a teacher in Thailand whose primary teaching tool and methodology
is the cultivation of loving-kindness. Sometimes he will have people
work towards the establishing of loving-kindness to themselves and
won’t encourage them to go beyond that, for a year, two years,
three years. Just keep working on that. That’s the core. Don’t
get ambitious until you can lay that base and establish it solidly
within yourself. </font></font>

<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">As
an exercise, it is interesting to see what happens to the mind as we
allow loving-kindness to expand and pervade. Again, if you feel there
is some obstruction coming up, reestablish that there is no rush to
go anywhere. The main object of the contemplation or meditation is to
establish mettā, the object of loving-kindness within the heart. And
that’s what we allow to grow, nourishing and supporting that. </font></font>

<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If
we are able to extend that feeling outward and find that it is useful
for our cultivation, all well and good. But again, pay attention to
the experience, investigating, “Is it useful? Is it working? Is it
helpful?” “I will abide, pervading the all-encompassing world
with a mind imbued with loving-kindness; abundant, exalted,
immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will.” </font></font>
