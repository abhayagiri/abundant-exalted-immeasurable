Relinquishment</font></p>
<p class="western" align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Basic">A
couple of people astutely noticed that I had skipped a few lines of
the </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Mettā Sutta</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">.
I consciously did that because I wanted to take the time to address
them. I had spent pretty much the full hour talking about the </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Mettā
Sutta</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"> up to that point, and I
thought, “I don’t want to open up this can of worms and go on
longer.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">The </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Mettā
Sutta</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"> lays the basis and
foundation of the cultivation of mett</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">ā</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
in terms of conduct, speech, and how we live in the world. It then
goes into the actual cultivation of loving-kindness, giving different
parameters, guidelines, and encouragement, saying we should sustain
the recollection of mettā, which “is said to be the sublime
abiding.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">The sutta ends with, “By not holding to
fixed views, the pure-hearted one, having clarity of vision, being
freed from all sense desires, is not born again into this world.”
With just a cursory glance, we might think, “How did that get
tacked on? That doesn’t have anything to do with mettā.” But I
think that we actually bring mettā to complete fruition by having
the insight and understanding not to be caught in views, opinions,
and attachment to our perspectives. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic">Being freed from all sense desires”
is a radical relinquishing of attachment. For loving-kindness to
manifest fully and come to fruition, we need to undermine the
fundamental roots of attachment, defilement, and clinging. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">So this takes mettā practice and ramps it
up to another level, bringing it to a liberating insight practice. As
we cultivate loving-kindness, the heart becomes more attuned to its
own movement. We start to feel the movement within the heart more
clearly. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Wanting to take a fixed view or have a
position involves a feeling of contention and conflict, a feeling of
butting up against something or somebody. How do we deal with that?
Do we just swamp it with loving-kindness and make it go away? That is
one way.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Or, do we say, “Well, what’s the root
of that? What’s the root of that feeling, of having to hold a view
of right or wrong. . . good or bad. . . this is correct. . . this is
incorrect. . . it’s got to be this way.” What is the root of
that? The root is the sense of self, of “I am.” The mettā
practice is a very skillful means of softening and opening the heart,
so that it’s able to tune in and say, “Well, that’s suffering.”
Even if your view is correct, holding it with a sense of self is
still suffering! </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">We prop up views and positions and then
land in places of suffering. “I had such loving-kindness going. How
did I get back to this point of suffering again?” That is the way
it works when there is still greed, hatred, and delusion, when there
are still the underlying roots of the </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>ā</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>sava</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,
the outflows. In order for mettā to come to fruition, we need to
shine a light on the deeper-rooted tendencies. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">How do we work with them? Of course, one
of the ways of working with them is with loving-kindness, in the
sense that if we set ourselves up in opposition with our minds, then
we are in a constant state of conflict. So, the kindest act that we
can do is to let go of defilement and attachment. That is the kindest
thing we can do for ourselves and others. We use the cultivation of
loving-kindness as a means of highlighting where we create opposition
and conflict, where we hold to a particular view, and how significant
views are in supporting negative underlying tendencies within the
mind. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">The Buddha outlined the three outflows or
</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">ā</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">savas</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,
as sensual desire (</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>kāmāsava</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">),
becoming (</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>bhavāsava</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">),
and ignorance (</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>avijjāsava—</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">not
knowing, not having true knowledge). Very soon after the Buddha’s
passing, commentators added the outflow of views (</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>ditthāsava</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">)
because it seemed fundamental as well. These are a source of
suffering and also perpetuate the round of rebirth. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Views are deeply rooted in the mind. Even
if they are not argumentative views, they still involve having to
take a position, having to be right or wrong. In the Buddha’s time,
there was a whole list of standard views that are probably not so
meaningful to us. But at the Buddha’s time, they were the
philosophical positions of the day. There were schools of religious
seekers and philosophers who took various positions. Is the cosmos
eternal or not eternal? What is the nature of the self? What is the
nature of the body and the mind? Do enlightened beings exist after
death? Do they not exist after death? Do they both exist and not
exist after death? Or, do they neither exist nor not exist after
death? </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">There were great philosophical debates and
conflicts about this. In a more modern setting, well, pick your view
of choice. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">There is a discourse in which Ānanda goes
into a wanderer’s park around Rajagaha and goes to a hot springs.
He meets a wanderer, who immediately starts questioning him:</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic">What teacher do you follow?” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic">I follow the son of the Sakyans,
Gotama.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic">What view do you hold? That the world
is eternal, this alone is true, anything else is wrong?”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic">I don’t hold to such a view, friend.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic">The world is not eternal; this alone is
true, anything else is wrong?”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic">I don’t hold to such a view, friend.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">The wanderer runs through the entire
litany of positions and Ānanda responds with each one, “I don’t
hold such a view, friend.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">The wanderer is perplexed with this and
asks, “Could it be that you don’t know or see?” Ānanda assures
him that he does know and see (an idiom for insight). What he knows
and sees is that all these different views are just speculative
views. By understanding the foundation of views, the obsession with
views, the origination of views, and the uprooting of views, there is
a true knowing and seeing. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">It’s a wonderful perspective on views,
opinions, and attachments. To be accomplished in not having views,
one doesn’t have to become a kind of space cadet, completely out
there, incapable of answering a question. But by recognizing how one
starts to fix oneself into a position, and seeing, “Oh, I’m
putting myself in opposition to that person or to that situation by
holding to that view and that’s going to lead to suffering,” then
one is able to step back from that position of holding to views. That
allows one to return to a place of mindfulness and clear
comprehension or discernment. That is what one takes as one’s
abiding place. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">We recognize that whatever comes up is
just a mental formation within the mind, just a thought or just a
perception. We can have a perception about something and realize that
it’s impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self. Sometimes we can
act on views or perceptions if they have a usefulness at that
particular time, but we are not building our home or sense of self
within that. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">To tie that in again with loving-kindness:
it’s being very kind to yourself and others because it doesn’t
take very long to recollect the last time you were at loggerheads
with somebody because of a particular view. You think about it
afterwards and wonder, “Why did I even go there? What was the point
of that anyway?” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">If we are not trapped by views, usually we
can respond quite skillfully, and that is exceedingly useful. Reflect
on the sense of non-contention as a basis for loving-kindness. There
is an idiom</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt"> </font><font face="Gentium Basic">in
the scriptural language that describes this mental state of attaching
to views: “this alone is true, anything else is wro</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt"><font face="Gentium Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">ng</font></font></font><font face="Gentium Basic">.”
It isn’t as if we have consciously thought this out or even
articulated it within the mind, but it is there. We can change our
views, but at that particular moment it feels like, “This is right
and everything else is wrong.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">As soon as we are in that kind of
position, it’s the basis for contention and conflict. It’s the
basis for feeling irritation and aversion, whether short or
protracted. Ill will is going to be attendant on holding that
particular view. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Try to make this very conscious through
the cultivation of loving-kindness so as not to allow the formation
of views to be so strong. Have a sense of loving-kindness and
well-wishing towards yourself because you are usually the first
person to suffer when you are tightly locked into a particular view.
Then, of course, others suffer as well. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">The active application of loving-kindness
is not just a nice emotion that we are able to generate sometimes
while we are sitting on our cushions. It’s a very practical
application of how we can interface with the world around us and not
be trapped by fixed views. It lays the basis for peace and clarity. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">One of the underlying principles of the
Dhamma that the Buddha pointed to is this aspect of letting go,
relinquishing, and putting down. We can let go: we can let go of a
mood, irritation, or aversion; we can let go of a view that’s
starting to arise; we can let go of a particular perspective of how I
think it has to be; we can let go of sense desires; and we can let go
of the whole construct of “I am.” It’s that letting go that
allows us to access and experience a real peace. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">There are a few places in the discourses
in which the Buddha is asked for a way to formulate these teachings
in a very succinct way. In the scriptures the Buddha says that all
</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>dhamma</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">s—</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>sabbe
dhamma</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">—are not to be clung
to, all </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>dhamma</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">s
are not worthy of holding on to, all </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>dhamma</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">s
are not to be attached to. All things, all </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>dhamma</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">s
with a small “d,” are not worthy of clinging. That’s a very
simple phrase that’s helpful for practice, especially in terms of
</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">mett</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">ā</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">
bh</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">ā</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">van</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">ā.
If we get entangled in the obstructions that come up in the mind or
try to analyze and figure them out too much, they hook us in. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">The answer is to be able to come from that
place of “all things are not to be clung to.” Maybe there is a
mood of distraction, irritation, or confusion, but all </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>dhamma</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">s
are not to be clung to. Then we need to bring into being the
cultivation of loving-kindness, which is an expansive, wholesome
quality that we ultimately have to let go of. But again, it’s a
useful bridge to putting our effort and attention into things that
help establish and sustain a sense of peace and clarity. So, the act
of letting go is a very useful tool. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">One of the places that this teaching comes
up is in a very interesting discourse, a well-known teaching that
most people who have been on a meditation retreat have probably heard
referred to in one way or another. It’s the discourse given to
Moggallāna when he was meditating and experiencing drowsiness (</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#000000"><font face="Gentium Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="background: transparent">A
7:61</span></font></font></font></font><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">)</font></font></font><font face="Gentium Basic">.
It was shortly after Moggallāna was ordained. He is practicing
diligently but is being overcome by drowsiness, sloth, and torpor.
The Buddha comes and gives him instruction. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">That set of instructions is, first, to
make your object of meditation clear. If that doesn’t work, then
use an image of light to bring brightness to the mind. Use a
recitation if that image of brightness doesn’t work.  If that
doesn’t work, pull your ears, rub your skin, and get some energy
going somehow.  If that doesn’t work, go out and look at the sky,
look at the stars.  If that doesn’t work, do some walking
meditation. In the end, if none of this works, then lie down and have
a rest, mindfully establishing a time for getting up and continuing
your practice. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">The Buddha continues on and gives
Moggallāna instruction in being careful not to get too involved with
or to draw too close to laypeople, because laypeople have busy lives,
and if you’re trying to be a part of their lives and they ignore
you, then you wonder, “Oh, what did I do wrong?” There are
endless complications. You’re a monk, do what monks do. Let
laypeople do what laypeople do. Don’t get too entangled in other
people’s lives. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Then the Buddha gives Moggallāna
instruction in maintaining a sense of circumspection in speech
because inevitably, a lot of conversation and talking ends up in a
lot of conflict. There are always misunderstandings. Restrain
yourself in speech, paying attention to maintaining humility and not
being proud wherever you go or whatever you do: good instructions for
a new monk.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
 <font face="Gentium Basic">Then Moggallāna asks the Buddha, “What
is the core of the teachings? What is their basis?” That’s when
the Buddha says that the fundamental teaching is that all </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>dhamma</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">s
are not to be clung to. When you don’t cling to things, you are not
building the momentum of habits and attachments. When you are not
building that momentum of habits and attachments, you are not
creating a sense of being sustained by them. When you are not being
sustained by all those habit patterns, then you can dwell free and
unsustained within the world and the body-mind complex. It’s a
wonderful teaching. It’s very, very direct. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">As we reflect and investigate, we see how
views—attachments to a sense of self, our sense of what we think is
right and wrong, how things should and shouldn’t be—are endlessly
frustrating, agitating, and a source of dukkha. The Buddha’s
perspective is not that we are trying to wipe it all out and
annihilate it, but rather that we are trying to understand the reason
why we take a position or view. We are seeing the dynamic of that
movement of mind that has to have a position of: “I am. . . I am
right. . . I am wrong. . . I am good. . . I am not good. . . I’m
correct. . . I’m wrong again”—all the positions that we take. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">The word “conceit” in Buddhism has a
whole level of meaning different from the way we normally use it in
the English language. According to the teachings, there are nine
different bases of conceit: </font>
</p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">All of that is the basis of conceit. This
is the act of trying to take a position all the time. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">You realize all of that is suffering:
trying to figure out “Who am I? Where am I?” in this realm of
relating to myself in the world around me and in comparison to
others. As soon as you go there, you’re trapped. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">So again, bring it back to kindness,
mettā: “May I abide in well-being; may all beings abide in
well-being.” That is a much safer position, being able to drop and
set aside all the “I”-making and “my”-making. This “I”-making
and “my”-making is constantly being constructed; it isn’t as if
the “I, me, and mine” is related to an actual fixed entity. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">This is something we are doing all of the
time. That is made really clear in the Pali words </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>aha</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>ṅ</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>k</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>ā</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>ra</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">

is the verb “to do”: the “I-doing” and “mine-doing.” We
are doing it and creating it, although it’s like the sorcerer’s
apprentice in </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Fantasia</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">.

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">The teachings of the Buddha give us the
tools to be able to allow that to be let go of, to be put down, to be
dropped. Of course that is a “doing” as well, but part of the
practice is the craft of placing attention. We need to be doing
something. On a certain level, we are doing something all the time.
It’s just the nature of the body and mind. But we can put attention
on the act of relinquishment, the act of kindness. Those are very
conscious acts that reap the fruits of well-being and peace. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">We need to remind ourselves to do this:
“One should sustain this recollection.” It’s reminding
ourselves and recollecting mindful application. As we relinquish,
“not holding to fixed views, the pure hearted one, having clarity
of vision, being freed from all sense desire, is not born again into
this world.” Somebody who is freed from all sense desires and is
not born again into this world is an </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>anāgāmi</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
or </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>arahant</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,
a non-returner or somebody who is a fully enlightened being. That’s
a real act of kindness, to be somebody who is fully able to penetrate
the teachings and to be completely free of the entanglements of

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Of course, the example closest to me, a
contemporary example, is Ajahn Chah. The Buddha’s example is still
resonating after 2,500 years. The act of relinquishment, being able
to be freed from all sense desires, turning away from the cycle of
</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt"><font face="Gentium Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>saṃsāra</i></font></font></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,
has had an extraordinarily powerful effect on the world. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Ajahn Chah set an example of
loving-kindness and had the ability to inspire people to practice. I
don’t know exactly how many monasteries in Thailand are affiliated
with Ajahn Chah—several hundred. And, of course, there is the
Western Sangha: America, Canada, England, France, Switzerland,
Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Australia, and Malaysia. Monasteries and
so many other places have grown up just from this small bullfrog of a
man. It’s like he sat on his lily pad in the middle of this
monastery, and everybody came to him. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Ajahn Chah’s loving-kindness was one
that came to fruition through commitment to relinquishment. When he
was asked, “What seems to have made the difference to you?” he
said, “Well, I always wanted to find an end to things.” He wasn’t
satisfied until he really found an end. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Ajahn Chah had a lot of difficulty in
practice. It wasn’t easy for him. On a certain level, that probably
made him a lot more kind and compassionate, since he could definitely
take in the foibles of the rest of us. He had the ability to see
through. He cultivated loving-kindness, but it isn’t as if he
didn’t have to deal with his own anger, aversion, or ill will. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">There is a nice story about Ajahn Chah. He
was sitting and teaching, as often happened, underneath his dwelling
place. A palm reader (an astrologer) was visiting and was captivated
by his humor and warmth. He finally screwed up the courage to ask
Ajahn Chah if he could look at the lines on his hands. Of course,
Ajahn Chah teased him and said, “Well, am I going to win the
lottery?” The palm reader looked at his hands and said, “Luang
Por, the lines in your hands—you’ve got a lot of anger!” Ajahn
Chah smiled and said, “Yes, but I don’t use it.” It’s those
simple words: you don’t negate personality or temperament, but you
have the wisdom and the clarity to say: “I really don’t want to
repeat that. Been there, done that. Time to let it go.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Another story about Ajahn Chah took place
when he had already been abbot of the monastery for some years. He
was a real taskmaster. If you talk to the really senior monks, you
would find out it was not much fun; he was very strict. One day,
after the meal, everyone else had finished and left. As Ajahn Chah
was walking past a novice, he saw the novice standing, picking up a
kettle, and, rather than going to find a cup, drinking directly from
it. Ajahn Chah lost it. In the first place, it is impolite for a monk
or novice to stand and drink. And then to do it by drinking straight
from the kettle was too much.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Ajahn Chah took one look and just bolted
after the lad. He was going to beat this little novice. The novice
saw him and was out of there. Ajahn Chah chased after him, trying to
catch the novice to thrash him. The novice was quicker and got away.
Then it hit Ajahn Chah, what he was doing. He went back to his
dwelling place and didn’t come out for three days. He sat and
worked with that anger. He didn’t come out, go on almsround, or
eat. The monks said that after that occasion, nobody ever saw him
display anger again. It was very, very interesting. He just realized,
“This is painful, this is suffering, and I’ve really got to deal
with it.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Teachers who are wise or compassionate
aren’t born like that—that’s not how it works. You have to work
at it; you have to deal with it. There needs to be the realization:
this is suffering and there is a way out of this. It’s seeing that
taking rebirth again and again; even if it’s pleasant, is not worth
it. This is a tremendous gift of kindness to the world. That’s
something that we can be doing, each in our own way. We can set that
intention, that resolution. </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">Mettā
bhāvanā</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic"> is not an
indulgent way of making yourself feel good for a little bit. It’s
cultivating the roots of your liberation and recognizing what is of
benefit to you and all beings. So I offer that for reflection this
morning.</font></p>
