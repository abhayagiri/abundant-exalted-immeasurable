<font face="Gentium Book Basic"><b>Mettā Retreat – Day 7 –
Morning - Closing Ceremony</b></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic">First of all, I’d like to express
my appreciation to Susan, Karen, and Cassidy for pulling this retreat
together and being willing to step into the unknown: to see how to do
it and take a chance on whether it actually worked or not. I’ve
enjoyed my time here. I express my appreciation to all of you, the
retreatants who came together and who have been interested and
willing to pursue this exploration of loving-kindness. As I have
tried to emphasize through this retreat, loving-kindness doesn’t
stand on its own. It is a part of a spectrum of the Buddha’s
teachings, both in terms of support of those teachings and also as a
result of those teachings. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic">I would encourage you all to take
what you have learned during this time back into the world—into the
family, society, and workplace—and experiment on how to apply these
teachings, how to sustain them. Having finished the retreat, whatever
peacefulness, loving-kindness, and clarity you have cultivated,
please take it with you. You don’t need to leave it all here. Take
it, share it, and recognize that it is a gift to other people as
well. Sharing loving-kindness, virtue, and goodness: these are
suitable things to share with others, and the world is desperately in
need of them.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic">This simple ceremony that we have
just done, the refuges and the five precepts, is something that is
quite ubiquitous in Buddhist tradition. But I would encourage all of
you to take it on board, investigate, and see how these refuges and
precepts can both be an anchor for day-to-day life as well as the
fruit of a skillful life well lived. Having a refuge, having an
anchor in clarity of conduct, allows that virtue and holding to truth
to be the basis of one’s life.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic">I mentioned in one of the Dhamma
talks that one of the most common formulations that the Buddha gives
for the description of the stream-enterer, the first fruit of
realization and liberation, was the stable confidence and faith in
Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, and the stable commitment to the
precepts. It is easy to overlook that as being ordinary. That’s one
of the problems we have as humans beings, we overlook the ordinary,
being busy looking for something else. Of course, our whole life
tends to be looking for something else to satisfy us, and we overlook
the opportunities of satisfaction and contentment in the present
moment. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic">We look for refuges, look for things
to solve all our problems, for things to shore up our sense of
well-being—just over there. And it is usually just out of reach as
well. In contrast, we can return to the things that we normally might
conceive of as ordinary and realize the power of transformation that
they hold: the power of the refuges, the power of the precepts, and
the power of loving-kindness.    </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic">On a certain level it is hackneyed
and old: “May all beings be well and happy.” You see it written
everywhere in Buddhist texts, and you might even sign your emails
with something like that. But recognize that there is a
transformative power in it: an actual commitment and understanding of
how to apply it, how to work with it, how to rely on it, and how to
return to it allows it to be something that nourishes the heart and
nurtures your day-to-day life.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic">The whole week that we’ve been
here, what I’ve been teaching and emphasizing is pretty ordinary
stuff. Certainly most people have heard it or read it at some time or
another. But I think it’s when we make a commitment within
ourselves to put it in to practice, give it the space to see if it
works, and have the confidence to stay with it for a while: that’s
when the transformation takes place. It isn’t as if somebody is
going to get a new bit of information that is going to transform
them. It is rather the old and the ordinary that is probably most
useful. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic">Recognize, reflect, investigate, and
allow those things to reverberate in consciousness. Be willing to
keep experimenting, applying, and seeing what are the new ways of
holding a particular perspective, practice, mode of conduct, or way
of training oneself. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic">As for myself, this is my
thirty-fifth year of being a monk, and there are not a whole lot of
new things that I learn. But what I </font><font face="Gentium Book Basic"><i>have</i></font><font face="Gentium Book Basic">
learned is how to use the ordinary: the foundations that are so
important, the things that are the ground of the teachings and our
training. As we develop a deepening appreciation and a deepening
skill in how to use these, then we see some radical letting go take
place, some radical willingness to put a lot of the things down that
we didn’t want to be carrying around anyway. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Book Basic">So again, I would just like to
express my appreciation to all of the people who have helped out.
Everybody helped out in this retreat in the sense that, while you
have been here, you pitched in; everybody made it happen. That is
worthy of appreciation. My own perception of things, and what the
organizers have told me, is that everything has gone very smoothly.
That is really appreciated when we come together and practice: having
a tangible example that when everybody pitches in, helps out, and
harmonizes, then life goes pretty smoothly. In the human realm,
that’s about as good as it gets. </font>
