<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Gentium Basic">As
we cultivate this meditation on loving-kindness, a variety of
formulations can be used. Some of them can be quite complicated and
some quite simple. What is most important is to recognize how it
works, how it affects us. What is it that resonates and helps bring
into being a feeling and perception of loving-kindness, an interest
in the wish for well-being in oneself and others? </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">As a meditation, the use of words and
phrases are helpful ways of establishing mindfulness or
recollections. We can use a phrase to plant that seed within the
heart and mind. Because the nature of the mind is to come up with
different thoughts and usually, with stories (not just short, little
sentences here or there), we use those phrases to help keep the mind
on track: “Oh right, I’m doing loving-kindness meditation.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">So using those phrases, perhaps from the
Buddha’s discourse on loving-kindness—“Wishing in gladness and
in safety, may all beings be at ease” or “May I be well, happy,
and peaceful”—is a way of keeping the mind on track and reminding
it what it’s intending to do. So that is actually the meditation;
that is how we train the mind. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">In Thailand, one of the most common
meditation methods or techniques is using the word “</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Buddho</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,”
the name of the Buddha. “</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Bud</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">”
on the in-breath and “</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>dho</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">”
on the out breath: just that simple word. If you want, you can use
the word “mettā”: “met” on the in-breath and “tā” on
the out-breath. Use that word to keep the mind on track. Tune in to
the feeling, the connotations of mettā you have reflected on. This
helps the mind to channel its attention and energy to the pleasing
emotional tone of well-wishing. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">In meditation practice, mettā has the
very useful function of providing emotional moisture. If you think,
“</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Anicca, dukkha, anatta,
anicca, dukkha, anatta, anicca, dukkha, anatta</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,”
it gets pretty dry after a while. “Impermanence,
unsatisfactoriness, not self, impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, not
self” are very true. However, the mind has to be prepared and
balanced. </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">Mettā
bhāvanā</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i> </i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">can
be a very useful basis for providing a sense of moisture, warmth, and
brightness to the mind. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">The opposite is true as well. If </font><font face="Gentium Book Basic">you
really see impermanence</font><font face="Gentium Basic">,
unsatisfactoriness, and not-self, one of the sure indications that
the insight is a true one is the sense of universal kindness and
well-wishing that arises. You think, “Wow, everyone is in the same
boat.” Then there is a sense of caring, the heart’s natural
response to a deep insight. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Usually, we don’t start with deep
insights. It’s good to sprinkle in a bit of mett</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">ā</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
to lubricate the insights and heart so that it’s ready, ripe, and
able to respond. Also, as we continue in this particular spiritual
practice, it is quite natural to become inured or accustomed to the
particular pattern of reflection, investigation, and practice we are
doing. So having supportive practices helps create a broad base for
practice and insight to ripen. It gives us the energy for practice. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Today I’d like to introduce as a
meditation, the chant, “</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="background: transparent">Reflections
on Universal Well-Being</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,”
which </font><font face="Gentium Book Basic">are all four </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">brahma
vihāras</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">. Almost half of the
chant is specifically about mett</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">ā</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,
loving-kindness. I think that is quite appropriate in that mettā is
really the doorway into the other brahma vihāras. As we are able to
establish the wish for well-being, this loving-kindness lays the
foundation for the qualities of compassion, sympathetic joy, and
equanimity. To try to establish equanimity or sympathetic joy on its
own is not that easy, but loving-kindness is an appropriate doorway
into these sublime abidings. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
 <font face="Gentium Basic">The chant begins with a very direct
statement: in P</font><font face="Gentium Basic">ā</font><font face="Gentium Basic">li,
“</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Aha</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>ṁ</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>
sukhito homi</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">,”</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
which is “May I be happy.” Of course, if you’re chanting “May
I be happy,” it falls a bit flat. Whereas, if you begin a chant,
“May I abide in well-being,” it’s kind of nice to chant. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic">May I be happy” is a very precise
translation of “A</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">haṁ
sukhito homi</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,” but I think
it is appropriate to take a bit of poetic license, to make it a bit
more chantable: “May I abide in well-being.” For me, having
chanted this for decades now, that is what happens when I think of
the words. When I use it as a meditation, it comes out as a chant.
It’s kind of hard for me just to say it. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">It’s a very beautiful chant. Establish
that wish: “May I abide in well-being, may I abide in happiness,
may I abide in the basis of all that is pleasurable and delightful.”
The wish directs attention to oneself. That is very much the
classical mode of the cultivation of loving-kindness: to direct
attention inward and establish that very strong feeling of
well-wishing towards oneself. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">In the scriptures, there is a very lovely
exchange between King Pasenadi and Queen Mallika. He was the king of
Kosala, in which is Savatthi, where the Buddha spent the majority of
his Rains residences in Jeta's Grove and elsewhere in the region. So
he was very familiar with King Pasenadi. Queen Mallika was a devout
Buddhist and had a solid practice. King Pasenadi had tremendous faith
in the Buddha, but there is never any mention of him having attained
any levels of liberation. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">In any event, in the palace, King Pasenadi
asks Queen Mallika, “Who is it that you cherish the most?” Queen
Mallika replies, “Well, I cherish myself the most.” “Hmmm,”
he thinks. He always takes her lead. He has tremendous love and
respect for her, so there must be something to this. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Pasenadi goes to the Buddha and recounts
the conversation. The Buddha says, “That’s exactly what one’s
attitude should be and that’s how it is in reality. It’s when we
cherish and honor ourselves fully that we can really look after and
cherish others. We need to have that foundation.” It isn’t a
selfish obsession with “me.” In reality, we do need to cherish
ourselves. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">If I eat something, nobody else gets full.
We relate to ourselves first on a cellular level. So, on an emotional
level, we need to attend to ourselves in appropriate and skillful
ways. When we look after ourselves, attend to our well-being, that is
when we can be a refuge and be there for others. As human beings,
we’re not all that different, despite all of our assumptions about
our fascinating uniqueness. We’re not very different, so when we
tune in and understand ourselves, we can be really present for
others. It’s our unskillful obsession with ourselves that blocks us
off from others. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; background: transparent; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">So, establish that sense of “May I abide
in well-being.” Take that in and open the heart to the sincere
wish, “May I abide in well-being and freedom from affliction.” In
Pāli the phrase is “</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>niddukkho
homi</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,” without dukkha,
without suffering. “In freedom from hostility” is “</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>avero
homi</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">.” </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Vera</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
is conflict and also grudges—the grudges and conflicts that
ironically bind us together. In Thai, there is a </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="background: transparent">phrase
</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">that you say when something
goes wrong. In English, we say, “Oh, shoot.” In Thai, it’s
“</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>wain g</i></font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Gentium Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">a</font></font></font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Gentium Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">m</font></font></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,”
“Oh, this is conflict and kamma.” Establish the wish, “May I
abide in freedom from hostility,” in freedom from any kind of
conflict. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Abyapajjho homi</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">”</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">:
freedom from ill will. </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Byapada</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
is ill will, anger, irritation, aversion. “May I abide in freedom
from ill will.” “</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>An</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>ī</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>gho
homi</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">”</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">:
in freedom from anxiety, worry, or fear. Establish that wish, “May
I abide in freedom from anxiety.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Sukhi att</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>ā</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>na</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>ṁ</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>
parihar</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>ā</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>mi</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">”</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">:
</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>atta</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
is me, self. “</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="background: transparent">May

Draw attention to that wish for freedom from affliction, hostility,
ill will, and anxiety, and that wish to maintain well-being.
Establish yourself as grounded in well-being. As you develop this as
a meditation, going through the phrases, you can repeat it many times
until it feels solid and you feel grounded in well-being. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Then allow it to be a bit more
non-directional: not directed toward yourself, but a bit more
pervasive: “May everyone abide in well-being.” In the P</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">ā</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">li,
“</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Sabbe satta</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>sukhit</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>ā</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>
hontu</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">”:
</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>“</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">May
all beings abide in well-being; may all beings be happy.” Then
proceed to similar recollections or aspirations. “</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Sabbe
satta avera hontu</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">”:</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
“May all beings abide in freedom from hostility, ill will, and
anxiety.” Those feelings of fear, worry, and anxiety are part of
not just the human condition, but the universal condition of having a
life force, whether it’s a human being, a mammal, or an insect. As
soon as you have a life force, you’re protecting it. Every being
wants to get away from pain or any kind of threat. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Of course, there is going to be some kind
of threat. Living in the forest, animals are constantly attuned to
danger. Abhayagiri is in the forest, and there are lots of animals
there. Deer, particularly the does, don’t have any clear physical
means of aggression, but they have big ears and they are listening.
They have big eyes and they’re on the lookout for anything that
might be a bit threatening. There is anxiety there. That is the
nature of being born into a physical body: we are vulnerable. We can
obsess on this and keep spinning ourselves out with anxiety. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">There is a book by Robert Sapolsky, </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Why
Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">. If
there is danger and a lion attacks, zebras are out of there as
quickly as they can. They might even be mauled or see a friend
mauled, but as soon as it’s over, they’re out there grazing
again. Human beings, on the other hand, are constantly planning about
the next perceived threat, which may or may not happen. And we end up
with ulcers. It’s a response that serves us well in certain
circumstances, but when it’s applied across the board, it doesn’t
really serve us that well. Dwelling in anxiety is exceedingly
uncomfortable. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">On the sheet of paper I passed out on the
sharing of loving-kindness, there is a very similar formulation, with
a bit of a twist that is very nice. But it uses those same structures
and is very classical. It is out of a very early commentarial
treatise, the </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Patisambhidāmag</i></font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Gentium Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">g</font></font></font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Gentium Basic"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">a</font></font></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,
which is so old it’s in the Pāli Canon. These are the formulations
for one of the ways for the cultivating of loving-kindness:
developing freedom from hostility, </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="background: transparent">freedom
from ill will, freedom from anxiety, and then the wish for happiness</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">.
So that as we cultivate this recitation and recollection, we
cultivate the feeling, “May I be well, happy, and peaceful. And
just as I wish to be well, happy, and peaceful, may all beings be
well, happy, and peaceful.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">This is recognizing that that wish is not
just isolated or focused solely on oneself. “In the same way that I
wish to be well, happy, and peaceful, may all beings experience that.
May I be free from animosity. As I wish to be free from animosity,
may all beings be free from animosity. May I be free from any kind of
suffering. And as I wish to be free from any kind of suffering, may
all beings be free from any kind of suffering. May I live in peace
and happiness. And as I wish to live in peace and happiness, may all
beings live in peace and happiness.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">These are helpful phrases or structures.
It’s helpful to become knowledgeable about P</font><font face="Gentium Basic">ā</font><font face="Gentium Basic">li,
the scriptural language, because sometimes our own English language
has a backlog of associations and habit patterns that affect our
thoughts and condition our reactions. As we delve into Buddhism, the
P</font><font face="Gentium Basic">ā</font><font face="Gentium Basic">li
language, and not just these phrases, can be very helpful. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">The only function the P</font><font face="Gentium Basic">ā</font><font face="Gentium Basic">li
language has performed over the last 2,300 years or so is to maintain
the discourses of the Buddha. It’s a technical language, and the
Buddha probably spoke something very similar—there’s controversy
about that. P</font><font face="Gentium Basic">ā</font><font face="Gentium Basic">li
is a mid-Indian, ancient dialect that the scriptures were written
down in. So even if it wasn’t exactly what the Buddha spoke at that
time, it’s very, very close. And its only function has been to pass
on the words of the Buddha, the scriptures, and the teachings. It’s
a technical language geared to spiritual themes. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; background: transparent; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">As I’ve been mentioning over the past
couple of days, </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">kusala</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
and </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">akusala</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
are technical terms that point to a particular state of mind that is
wholesome, skillful, and beneficial and the opposite,</font><font color="#000000"><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="background: transparent">
respectively</span></font></font><font face="Gentium Basic">. They
have particular parameters. </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">Tanha</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
is a specific desire rooted in greed, hatred, delusion, and
non-recognition of the way things truly are. When the Buddha says
</font><font face="Gentium Basic"><span style="font-style: normal">tanha</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic">
is the source of suffering, he’s not saying desire, as a generic
term, is the source of suffering. Rather, it’s a specific form of
desire. So, it’s helpful sometimes, as an exercise, to familiarize
yourself with some of the basic terms. Then things start to leap out.
</font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">As you consciously cultivate the quality
of loving-kindness, bring attention to “May I abide in well-being,”
trying to establish that wish firmly and clearly towards yourself
within the heart. But it doesn’t just affect you; it transforms you
and, by transforming you, it has an effect on the world and people
around  you. After a week of loving-kindness practice and training,
go back home or to your workplace and take note of anything you find
different there. Or does someone say in disbelief, “You’ve come
back from a week of loving-kindness?” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">There is a story in the </font><font face="Gentium Basic"><i>Visuddhimagga</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic">,
a commentarial treatise, about a man from India who hears about Sri
Lanka and how there are lots of people practicing meditation there.
This is almost 1,000 years after the Buddha passed away. Big changes
happened in India at that time, and Buddhism was flourishing in Sri
Lanka. He has the intention to take ordination, so he gives up his
business, takes leave of his family, travels to Sri Lanka, and takes
ordination. He is interested in loving-kindness meditation, so he
gets instruction and goes to live in a place where many meditators
are practicing loving-kindness meditation. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">He lives in a particular hut in the
forest, surrounded by a nice grove of trees. He is very assiduous in
his cultivation of loving-kindness meditation and practices
diligently for four or five months. Then a wish comes into his mind,
“Maybe I’ll go off to another monastery and practice with such
and such a teacher.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">With the formulation of that wish, he
hears sobbing outside his dwelling place. So, he goes out and there
is this deity who lives in a big tree nearby. He asks what is wrong,
and the deity says, “You just had the thought that you want to
leave, and it makes me sad. While you’ve been here practicing
loving-kindness, I’ve been happy and all of the beings around here
have been happy. If you leave, all the other devas and non-human
beings are going to go back to arguing and quarreling, just like they
used to do. While you’ve been here practicing, everything has been
peaceful.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">So he stays longer and continues with his
practice. In good Buddhist fashion, this happens three times.
Finally, he gives up his determination to go anywhere and stays there
and attains enlightenment, which is what always seems to happen in
the stories. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">One could say it’s just a shaggy-dog
story from the scriptures, but I know of a monk who had something
very similar happen. He really embodies loving-kindness. He’s still
living—his name is Ajahn Gunhah, and he is a nephew of Ajahn Chah.
Now, he’s well into his sixties. He had some major realizations
when he was a junior monk. When he was a younger monk, he practiced
diligently, and the quality of loving-kindness is a predominant
feature of his being. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">He was traveling by himself one time,
before he established a regular monastery. This was along the border
of Burma, in an area where there were big expanses of jungle but also
a lot of insurgents. He was walking through the jungle when</font><font face="Gentium Book Basic">
he </font><font face="Gentium Basic">walked into a large encampment
of Communist insurgents. They immediately surrounded him with weapons
and tried to grill him: how did he get in there? They thought he was
a government spy because the whole area around their encampment was
mined and he had been able to walk through the minefields. They held
him for a long time  and continued to question him. But eventually,
when they realized he had been telling the truth and had indeed
walked through their minefields without having been blown up, they
warmed up to him and looked after him and fed him. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">After some time, they were convinced that
he was a genuine monk and that they should let him go. They
accompanied him, seeing him out through the minefields, and set him
on his way. Then they came back and there was a realization: “Why
did we let him go? It was so nice having a monk here. Everybody was
living harmoniously and happily. He was such a wonderful presence for
us.” So they tromped out after him and invited him to come back.
They would look after him for the Rains Retreat. He had already made
a commitment to spend the Rains in another place but expressed
appreciation for their offer. So, that is that presence of
loving-kindness. “While he was here, everything felt good.” </font>

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">So, let’s take some time just to sit and
use these phrases, this particular structure. Establish ease,
alertness, and comfort in the posture. Allow the breathing to be
natural, easeful. Relax any kind of tension. Allow the breath to come
in very, very clearly, without any obstruction. Allow the breath to
go out without any obstruction, not controlling, just feeling very
comfortable and at ease. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">As you physically feel at ease, attention
and mindfulness are present. Then formulate the wish, “May I abide
in well-being.” Allow the breath to come in and go out. Allow the
heart to resonate around that sincere wish, “May I abide in
well-being. May I abide in happiness. May I abide in freedom from
affliction.” Allow that to resonate through the body and the mind.
“May I abide in freedom from suffering and discomfort—mental,
physical, any kind of dukkha.” Establish that wish toward yourself,
cherishing yourself with the sincere wish for freedom from anything
that is afflicting, obstructing. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
 <font face="Gentium Basic">Allow that wish to be an energy within
the body and mind. Allow that energy to flow through and permeate the
whole body, the whole mind: that sincere wish for happiness, freedom
from suffering. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic">May I abide in freedom from hostility.”
Allow the mind to relinquish and release any kind of hostile,
aversive, or negative intention toward yourself or others because the
first person harmed when you formulate an intention of hostility or
aversion is you. Release and relinquish any negativity with the clear
intention or wish: “May I abide in freedom from hostility. May I
abide in freedom from ill will.” Again, not setting up any kind of
contention or conflict, put it all down and direct that wish,
feeling, and aspiration for well-being toward yourself. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic">May I abide in freedom from anxiety.”
Recognize the inevitable tendency toward fear, worry, and anxious
wondering, but set the intention: “May I abide in freedom from any
kind of anxiety.” Recognize that it would be a very different world
for you and others around you if there </font><font face="Gentium Book Basic">was
</font><font face="Gentium Basic">freedom from such anxiety and fear.
</font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic">May I maintain well-being in myself.”
Return to the wish, the aspiration for stability of well-being, a
steady sense of happiness that comes when the mind is not overwhelmed
by negative habits of mind. Recognize that this is actually possible.
It’s a noble aspiration to set for yourself. It’s holding
yourself dear, cherishing yourself in an appropriate way. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Allow these aspirations and recollections,
this loving-kindness, to permeate and pervade the body and mind. As
that is increasingly well-established and feels stable, allow the
focus to be broader. Expand the focus so that it encompasses
everything around you, inclusive of all others. “May all beings
abide in well-being. May everyone abide in well-being. May everyone
abide in freedom from hostility.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
 <font face="Gentium Basic">We can’t force the world and all beings
to live that way, but we can have that aspiration. We can perceive
the benefit. Hold that within the heart. “May everyone abide in
freedom from ill will.” We can see the suffering and pain that
arise from ill will, so develop that sincere wish of compassion,
friendliness, and care. Wish that all beings abide in freedom from
ill will. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Allow the heart to be open and expansive,
wishing safety and security. “May everyone abide in freedom from
anxiety.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
“<font face="Gentium Basic">May all beings maintain well-being in
themselves.” As we’re able to establish that intention without
division within the mind, we stop separating anybody out into “us”
and “them,” my group and that group. Develop that expansive wish
and aspiration, that everyone be able to maintain well-being in him
or herself. This allows the mind to break down the barriers of how we
habitually compare and divide, and suffer because of it. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Basic">Cultivation of these phrases and tuning in
to the feelings they generate are helpful for the cultivation of a
mood of loving-kindness, and they also give us an insight into the
way the mind works, how we cherish or overlook ourselves, how we look
at others, how we compare, how we judge. In the loving-kindness
meditation, with allowing the heart to abide in kindness and
well-being, there is no judging or comparing. </font>
