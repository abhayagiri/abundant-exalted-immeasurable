boundless, unconditional love of a mother: An image that I will
forever carry in my heart is of my own mother as she waited for death
to relieve her of a tired and malfunctioning body.  Only four days
before her passing she sat on the edge of the bed in the evening, in
an attempt to find a moment of comfort or ease after a long day.  As
I sat next to her, the tears I had been hoping to hold in secret
spilled forth and I blurted out the sense of impending loss I was
feeling, how much I would miss her.  In that instant her own
discomfort and suffering were forgotten as some hidden energy source
lifted her body from the slight slouch and she put her arm around me
to comfort me and remind me that we carry each other in our hearts.</span></font></p>

<font face="Gentium Book Basic, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">When
Luang Por Pasanno completed the teaching of the retreat that is the
source of this book in September of 2008, a handful of us declared
enthusiastically that we would produce a book so others could also
benefit from this retreat.  Time passed.  My mother passed.  The idea
to put these teachings into a book resurfaced but this time with a
deeper intention.  It felt like a wonderful tribute to my mother, to
all mothers--whether from a biological mother or someone who has fit
the ideal, perhaps a father, aunt, uncle, older sibling, friend,
teacher......  An expression of the gratitude for the example and the
love.</span></font></p>

<font face="Gentium Book Basic, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Many
have contributed generously to the development of the book â€“ the
transcribers,  the  various editors, layout team and proof readers. 
Tom Lane for his monumental effort in editing, Hisayo Suzuki for her
sharp eye and mind with the line editing and Sumi Shin with the
creative and expressive cover design.  I am grateful to all who
paricipated  and contributed in this wonderful community effort
resulting in this offering in honor of mothers (past, present and to
come)--a lovely transference of the energy of love and gratitude into
something produced for the benefit of others, seen and unseen.</span></font></p>
