<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, serif">That
boundless, unconditional love of a mother: An image that I will
forever carry in my heart is of my own mother as she waited for death
to relieve her of a tired and malfunctioning body.  Only four days
before her passing she sat on the edge of the bed in the evening, in
an attempt to find a moment of comfort or ease after a long day.  As
I sat next to her, the tears I had been hoping to hold spilled forth.
I blurted out the sense of impending loss I was feeling, how much I
would miss her.  In that instant her own discomfort and suffering
were forgotten. Some hidden energy source lifted her body from its
slight slouch. She put her arm around me to comfort me and remind me:
&quot;We carry each other in our hearts.&quot;</font></p>

<font face="Gentium Book Basic, serif">When Luang Por Pasanno
completed the teaching of the retreat that is the source of this book
in September of 2008, a handful of us declared enthusiastically that
we would produce a book so others could also benefit from this
retreat.  Time passed.  My mother passed.  The idea to put these
teachings into a book resurfaced but this time with a deeper
intention.  It felt like a wonderful tribute to my mother, to all
mothers----whether from a biological mother or someone who has fit
the ideal, perhaps a father, aunt, uncle, older sibling, friend,
teacher......  --An as an expression of the gratitude for the example
and the love.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Gentium Book Basic, serif">Many
have contributed generously to the development of the book &ndash;
the transcribers,  the  various editors, layout team and proof
readers.  : In particular, Tom Lane for his monumental effort in
editing, Hisayo Suzuki for her sharp eye and mind with the line
editing and Sumi Shin with the creative and expressive cover design. 
I am grateful to all who participated  and contributed in this
wonderful community effort. This offering is in honor of mothers,
past, present and to come. It represents a beautiful transference of
the energy of love and gratitude into something produced for the
benefit of others, seen and unseen.</font></p>
