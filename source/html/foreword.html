<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Gentium Basic, serif">That
boundless, unconditional love of a mother: an image that I will
forever carry in my heart is of my own mother as she waited for death
to relieve her of a tired and malfunctioning body. Only four days
before her passing, she sat on the edge of the bed in the evening in
an attempt to find a moment of comfort or ease after a long day. As I
sat next to her, the tears I had been hoping to hold spilled forth. I
blurted out the sense of impending loss I was feeling, how much I
would miss her. In that instant her own discomfort and suffering were
forgotten. Some hidden energy source lifted her body from its slight
slouch. She put her arm around me to comfort me and reminded me: “We
carry each other in our hearts.”</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Gentium Basic, serif">When
Luang Por Pasanno completed the teaching of the retreat that is the
source of this book in September of 2008, a handful of us declared
enthusiastically that we would produce a book so others could also
benefit from this retreat. Time passed. My mother passed. The idea to
put these teachings into a book resurfaced, but this time with a
deeper intention. It felt like a wonderful tribute to my mother, to
all mothers—whether from a biological mother or someone who has fit
the ideal, perhaps a father, aunt, uncle, older sibling, friend, or
teacher—as an expression of the gratitude for the example and the
love.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Many
have contributed generously to the development of the book: the
transcribers, various editors, layout team, and proofreaders—in
particular, Tom Lane for his monumental effort in editing, Hisayo
Suzuki for her sharp eye and mind with the line editing, and Sumi
Shin for the creative and expressive cover design. I am grateful to
all who participated and contributed in this wonderful community
effort. This offering is in honor of mothers, past, present, and to
come. It represents a beautiful transference of the energy of love
and gratitude into something produced for the benefit of others, seen
and unseen.</font></p>

are all very grateful for the limitless generosity that Luang Por
