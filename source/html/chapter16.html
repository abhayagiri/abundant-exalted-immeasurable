<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">This afternoon, I thought I’d take the
opportunity to do some sutta readings about loving-kindness and give
people the real scoop—I’ve rambled on long enough. There are some
sutta readings that are interesting in that they are not so familiar
to people or take something familiar and cast it in a new light. Then
there are some that are daily-life applications of loving-kindness. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">The first one I thought I would read is one
I have mentioned. It’s an occasion when the Buddha goes to visit
three monks, one of whom is the Venerable Anuruddha, who was a very
accomplished monk and also the Buddha’s cousin. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">The Buddha was departing from a situation
not mentioned in the sutta. A particular monastic community was in
disharmony. Actually, there was a schism happening in the sangha. The
Buddha tried to intervene, and they encouraged the Blessed One to
live in peace: “We’ll sort this out,” which meant, “We are
going to go at it tooth and nail.  Please don’t get in our way.”
He gave up on them, went off on his own, and came across three monks
who were living in a woodland area. The Buddha sat down, and the
monks paid their respects to him. </font>

“<font face="Gentium Plus">I hope, Anuruddha, that you are all

 “<font face="Gentium Plus">Venerable sir, as to that, I think
thus: ‘It is a gain for me, it is a great gain for me, that I am
living with such companions in the holy life.’ I maintain bodily
acts of loving-kindness towards those venerable ones both openly and
privately; I maintain verbal acts of loving-kindness towards them
both openly and privately; I maintain mental acts of loving-kindness
towards them both openly and privately. I consider: ‘Why should I
not set aside what I wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish
to do?’ Then I set aside what I wish to do and do what these
venerable ones wish to do. We are different in body, venerable sir,
but one in mind.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Gentium Plus"><br>The venerable Nandiya and the venerable

<font face="Gentium Plus">That’s a delightful description of what
is possible in the human realm. There is another discourse in which

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Gentium Plus">	“So,
bhikkhus, when you take to quarreling and brawling and are deep in
	disputes, stabbing each other with verbal daggers, on that occasion
you do 	not maintain acts of loving-kindness by body, speech, and

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Gentium Plus">	and

you can neither convince each other nor be convinced by others, that
you can neither persuade each other nor be persuaded by others?
Misguided men, that will lead to your harm and suffering for a long
time.”<br></font><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
thus: “Bhikkhus, there are these six principles of cordiality that
create love and respect and conduce to cohesion, to non-dispute, to
concord, and to unity. What are the six?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Gentium Plus"><br>[1] “Here a bhikkhu maintains bodily
acts of loving-kindness both in public and in private towards his
companions in the holy life. This is a principle of cordiality that
creates love and respect, and conduces to cohesion, to non-dispute,
to concord, and to unity.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Gentium Plus"><br>[2] “Again, a bhikkhu maintains
verbal acts of loving-kindness both in public and in private towards
his companions in the holy life. This too is a principle of
cordiality that creates love and respect, and conduces to. . .
unity.<br><br>[3] “Again, a bhikkhu maintains mental acts of
loving-kindness both in public and in private towards his companions
in the holy life. This too is a principle of cordiality that creates
love and respect, and conduces to. . . unity.<br><br>[4] “Again, a
bhikkhu uses things in common with his virtuous companions in the
holy life; without making reservations, he shares with them any gain
of a kind that accords with the Dhamma and has been obtained in a way
that accords with the Dhamma, including even the mere contents of his
alms-bowl. This too is a principle of cordiality that creates love
and respect, and conduces to. . . unity.<br><br>[5] “Again, a
bhikkhu dwells both in public and in private possessing in common
with his companions in the holy life those virtues that are unbroken,
untorn, unblotched, unmottled, liberating, commended by the wise, not
misapprehended, and conducive to concentration. This too is a
principle of cordiality that creates love and respect, and conduces
to. . . unity.<br><br>[6] “Again, a bhikkhu dwells both in public
and in private possessing in common with his companions in the holy
life that view that is noble and emancipating, and leads one who
practices in accordance with it to the complete destruction of
suffering. This too is a principle of cordiality that creates love
and respect, and conduces to cohesion, to non-dispute, to concord,
and to unity.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">The six qualities of creating concord and
living together come up in different places in the suttas:
loving-kindness in acts, speech, and thought; sharing with
generosity; common virtue and common view. There is also the stock
phrase “virtues that are unbroken, untorn, unblotched, unmottled,
liberating, commended by the wise, not misapprehended, and conducive
to concentration.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">These virtues are also talked about as a
distinguishing characteristic of one who has entered the stream of
Dhamma: a stream-enterer. It is interesting how the Buddha most often
describes the stream-enterer not by their dazzling meditations or
astute wisdom, but by their qualities of faith in Buddha, Dhamma, and
Sangha, and well-established virtue. Such virtue in not
misapprehended, not clung to, not attached to. It is commended by the
wise and conducive to concentration. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">Virtue is settling. There is composure
involved. Virtue is not “keeping you in line,” but allowing you
to be established in a quality of non-remorse and well-being, so that
you can concentrate easily. It is a factor of our development of
meditation. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">This next sutta reading also comes from </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>The</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">
</font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>Middle-Length Discourses</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus">,
number 21. It’s a very famous sutta, </font><font face="Gentium Plus"><i>The
Simile of the Saw.</i></font><font face="Gentium Plus"> </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="Gentium Plus">There is a buildup to the simile. The
incident that gave rise to the teaching is that one of the bhikkhus
was in conflict with the other bhikkhus and was not taking
admonishment very well. The circumstance came to the attention of the
Buddha, so he called the monk to him and gave a teaching. He took the
occasion to teach all of the monks who were present, a situation that
often happened, not just in the Buddha’s time. I do it all the
time: a circumstance comes up and it is a great occasion to be used
as an example of application of Dhamma within the community. </font>

“<font face="Times, Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Gentium Plus"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">So
too, bhikkhus, some bhikkhu is extremely gentle, extremely kind,
extremely peaceful, so long as disagreeable courses of speech do not
touch him. But it is when disagreeable courses of speech touch him
that it can be understood whether that bhikkhu is really kind,
gentle, and peaceful. I do not call a bhikkhu easy to admonish who is
easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only for the sake
of getting robes, almsfood, a resting place, and medicinal
requisites. Why is that? Because that bhikkhu is not easy to admonish
nor makes himself easy to admonish when he gets no robes, almsfood,
resting place, and medicinal requisites. But when a bhikkhu is easy
to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish because he honors,
respects, and reveres the Dhamma, him I call easy to admonish.
Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train thus: ‘We shall be easy to
admonish and make ourselves easy to admonish because we honor,
respect, and revere the Dhamma.’ That is how you should train,
bhikkhus.</font></font></font></font></p>

there are these five courses of speech that others use when they
address you: their speech may be timely or untimely, true or untrue,
gentle or harsh, connected with good or with harm, spoken with a mind
of loving-kindness or with inner hate. . . Herein, bhikkhus,
[regardless of how someone speaks] you should train thus: ‘Our
minds will remain unaffected, and we shall utter no evil words; we
shall abide compassionate for their welfare, with a mind of
loving-kindness, without inner hate. We shall abide pervading that

not to give rise to any anger or ill will?” It’s possible if you

loving-kindness and with a conviction in the Dhamma, knowing that
because all beings are the owners of their actions, heirs of the
actions, born of their actions, and related to their actions, those
causes will result in rebirth in a particular way. The result of
anger, ill will, or any kind of violence is an unfortunate rebirth.
Being well-established in loving-kindness is a cause that produces a
result in exceedingly fortunate circumstances. In the long run, it is
worth training oneself so the option isn’t just aversion, ill will,

known—having realized it through direct knowledge—this world with
