<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">These are very useful reflections
because although the theme of this retreat is mettā,
loving-kindness, it’s essential to have an anchor, a stable base or
foundation to work from. Sometimes, trying to direct attention to a
mental state or an emotion is like trying to grab the wind—it slips
right through your fingers. But having a good grounding in the
quality of mindfulness that is focused on the body, you have a firm
basis to build from. As the Buddha said, all of these wholesome
qualities arise out of that mindfulness directed to the body. Once
you have a stable base, then you have a foundation for building
wholesome mental states. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Even if you are doing mettā as a
meditation, you still need to have an anchor. You still need to be
grounded in something and have someplace to keep returning to, which
is mindfulness of the body. Become very familiar with returning to
the body. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">There are many ways of using
mindfulness of the body, but in terms of the formal practice of
meditation, become familiar with mindfulness of breathing and bring
attention to the breathing process. Sit and pay attention to the
breath coming into the body: the sensation of the breath as it
touches the tip of the nose, as it passes through the nasal passages,
the back of the throat, down into the chest, the abdomen rising. Pay
attention to breathing out: the abdomen falling, the sensation in the
body, the chest area, throat, tip of the nose, the breath going out.
Tune in to that rhythm of the breath. Not forcing the breath, not
trying to regulate the breath, just attend to the breath as you are
experiencing it. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">There is a tendency for us to try
to regulate, oversee, or maintain the breath in some way, but that’s
adding an extra layer of complication. Unless you’re dead, you are
going to be breathing, so it happens anyway. Just tune in to the
breath: allow that sense of relaxing into the breathing. Also
recognize that the breathing takes place within the whole sphere of
the body. You are sitting here and breathing, but it isn’t as if
there’s just a nose suspended in space somewhere: you have the rest
of your body sitting here. How are you holding it? What does it feel
like? Is it comfortable? Is it uncomfortable? Does it feel spacious?
Does it feel contracted? What does the body feel like? Is there some
tension in the face, in the shoulders? Is it relaxed? Can you soften
that? What does it feel like in the abdomen? </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Relax the abdomen. It’s quite
interesting; the more comfortable we are with breathing, relaxing,
and settling, our posture gets better over time. It feels natural and
balanced. You don’t need to strain to hold the posture upright and
make yourself sit up straight. It’s obviously necessary, to some
degree, to try to keep an upright posture, but if there is too much
force or straining, it gets uncomfortable to sit straight. But as you
keep relaxing, softening, and releasing tension, you find that the
body naturally lines up quite nicely because that’s the most
comfortable way to sit for three-quarters of an hour, an hour, or
however long one sits in meditation. That’s the most natural way
for the body to sit. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">One of the images helpful in
sitting is imagining that there is a string or something similar at
the top of your head. If you were dangling from that string, how
would the spine and the shoulders line up? It would all be arranged
quite neatly, nice and straight. There would be a balance there. That
sense of an upright posture is one of comfort and ease as you
continue to relax.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">The core is the breathing. As you
breathe in, allow the breath energy to suffuse the body. The breath
comes in, suffusing the body with the feeling of warmth, of energy.
As the breath goes out, there is a sense of releasing, relaxing,
settling, non-clinging, not holding. You can’t hold on to the
breath. You can hold on to it for maybe a minute tops, but you start
turning blue, and that’s not very comfortable. That natural rhythm
of the breath suffuses the body with a sense of warmth and energy.
And then, as you breathe out, allow the body to feel suffused with a
sense of relaxing, of letting go, releasing. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">As we breathe in and we breathe
out, the air comes into the body, the air is expelled out of the
body. It’s released into the atmosphere, whirled around. In the
same way, thoughts, impressions, and feelings come into the mind.
Allow them to go back out again; release them, let them go. The
nature of the breath is to come in and go out. It’s the same thing
with thoughts, feelings, memories, and perceptions—it’s the
nature of the mind. We don’t have to hold on, cling, or make
anything of great importance out of it. We recognize: “That’s
just a thought, just a memory.” It comes into being, and we can let
it go out again. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Of course, thoughts and feelings
are much stickier than the breath, so it’s helpful to have the
image of the breath, that feeling of the breath coming in and going
out, and then extrapolate that to the feelings, perceptions,
memories, and thoughts. They can come in and go out as well. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Then there is a releasing, a
spaciousness that is very relaxing, very settling. The mind starts to
become clearer, more composed. It’s quite natural. When we allow
the breath to suffuse the body, allowing the breath to energize and
warm it, there is a relaxation that comes into the body. As we allow
the mind to have its thoughts and feelings arising and ceasing—coming
in and going out—the mind and the heart relax as well. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">You don’t force the mind to be
still or be clear. It’s through allowing the impressions in the
mind to come in and go out without reacting, clinging, or adding a
commentary that a natural clarity and spaciousness starts to arise.
Allow that to happen. It’s an exercise that we need to remind
ourselves to do. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Sometimes, when we have meditated
for years, it’s very easy to get into a rut or a habit. We perceive
ourselves in a certain way. We perceive our thoughts and feelings in
certain ways, and then we take the bait. I remember Ajahn Chah
saying, “Human beings are like fish. A fisherman puts a hook out;
it’s got a little bit of bait on it, and they go for it every time.
Well, actually, they’re not like fish at all. When fish take the
bait, it only gets caught in their mouth. Humans are more like frogs.
Frogs swallow that bait and the hook right down into the gut.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Remember: “I don’t need to take
the bait.” The bait is the feeling of liking and disliking, the
feeling of “that’s fearful, that’s intimidating,” “I really
like that, I really want that,” or “that’s important, I can’t
let that one go.” We take the bait. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">With that simple process of
attending impartially to something as uncomplicated as the breath
coming in and the breath going out, you might think, “That’s
pretty basic. When am I going to get on to the </font><font face="Gentium Basic, serif"><i>real</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic, serif">
meditation?” But that is what we have to learn how to do: we need
to develop the ability to relate to the mind, the world, and the body
in a way that we don’t get caught in reactions. That is how the
mind becomes settled and clear. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">That exercise of coming back to the
breath, the posture, and the body: how does it feel? Starting from
the top of the head and feeling, ask: “Is there a sense of tension
at the top of the head? The forehead, how can I relax that? What does
it feel like around the eyes? Can I relax that? Can I soften that?
Around the jaw, around the throat. . .” You are paying attention
and recognizing there is breathing—breathing in, breathing out.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">What does it feel like in the
shoulders, in the arms? What’s a comfortable position for the arms?
How can I hold them so that they hang comfortably and the hands can
be in an easeful position, relaxed and settled?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Feel the breath. Allow the breath
to suffuse and soften the body. Allow the chest to be open and
spacious, rather than contracting in. You can see that contraction
when you are pondering or recollecting something that has a weight to
it, trying to figure it all out. The head comes down and shoulders
come in. Bring some space to it, soften, relax. As the breath comes
in and the breath goes out, allow it to be open, soft, spacious. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Don’t tighten the abdomen. Allow
the breath to come down into the abdomen. Allow the breath to affect
the whole body, the whole trunk. Breathing in, the abdomen expands,
breathing out, it relaxes. If there is tension in the lower back,
soften it. Find a balance where holding the posture doesn’t take
any muscle—you can do this by allowing the trunk of the body to
relax and then letting it balance itself on its own. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Oftentimes, people will complain,
“My back hurts around the shoulder blades from all this sitting.”
A lot of that pain is caused by trying to hold the posture using the
chest, upper back, or shoulders—trying to </font><font face="Gentium Basic, serif"><i>hold</i></font><font face="Gentium Basic, serif">
the posture. It gets painful. So relax and allow the spine to rise up
out of the pelvis. That is what we have those bones for. They’re
much easier to look after than the muscles. Let the muscles do what
they’re going to do and just relax them. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Gentium Basic, serif">	We
have all the props: cushions, zafus, and whatever else we need to get
a balanced sense of posture and allow the muscles to relax. We can
relax into the posture, and then the breathing becomes much more
natural. Allow the rhythm to be very natural, not forcing it. Then
simply pay attention. Is this a long breath? Is this a short breath?
Is it comfortable? Is it uncomfortable? </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">You don’t have to go into any
more of an analysis than that. Attend to that: that’s soft, that’s
a bit hard, that’s short, that’s long. Just familiarize yourself
with the breath: that’s the in-breath, that’s the out-breath.
Attend to that, mindfully aware of where you are in the present
moment with the breathing process, mindfully aware of the general
feeling of the body, again, without going into an analysis and a
commentary. This is what it feels like. Does it need to be adjusted?
Does it need to be adapted in any way so that it can be a bit more
comfortable? </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">That is enough—sustaining the
attention on the breath, the in-breath and the out-breath. It’s
okay to adjust the posture a bit if necessary, balancing so that
you’re feeling comfortable. It’s important not to strain or to
strive too hard because the mind will only truly settle once there’s
relaxation. You can’t bludgeon your mind into submission; it’s
not going to work. You need to allow it to settle and then attend
very mindfully, sustaining the quality of awareness. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">It’s the quality and continuity
of awareness that allows the mind to settle and become peaceful. It’s
not imposing a concept, your idea of peacefulness, on the mind—that’s
not going to work. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Instead, relax and learn how to pay
attention. Experience the whole body. The breath is what we attend to
in a focused way, but in general, there is also the sense of what the
whole body is feeling like. Is it nice and straight? Is it balanced?
What are the different feelings that come up? </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Gentium Basic, serif">	Experience
those feelings in the body. Where in the body do we experience
anxiety and worry? Where do we feel it? What does it make the body
feel like? When a particular desire comes up, where do we feel that?
The experience of ill will and aversion in the body: where do we
sense that? What does it feel like? The body is a very clear measure
of our mental states. If we become more and more attentive, we
realize that the different mental states and moods we have are
experienced in the body and that we can relax around that. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">As you familiarize yourself, you
understand: “When my body is tensing like this, when my abdomen
gets tight, that’s anxiety, that’s fear” or “That’s worry,
that feeling in the chest.” The movement towards getting or
consuming something creates agitation in the body. In truth, we’re
not very discerning; we’re quite okay with whatever the flavor of
the moment is. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">However, we can see a repeated
pattern of how desire keeps playing itself out by the way that the
body is experienced. We can recognize how it works. Tune in to and
understand it: “There’s that feeling in the body.” It gives us
a clue. Usually when there’s a particular fear or desire or
aversion, the mind is so quick that it goes right into a story. It
has its justifications: “I wouldn’t think that if it wasn’t
‘right.’” Of course, we have all gotten ourselves into trouble
with those kinds of attitudes, and we believe it over and over again.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">So tune in to how it is felt in the
body. You can experience it without the story, and that is where you
can</font><font face="Gentium Basic, serif"><span style="background: #ffffff">
clarify it</span></font><font face="Gentium Basic, serif"> or allow
it to pass through. Again, with the breath, say, “I recognize that
feeling.” The mind is going to be whispering—probably
screaming—its story, but keep coming back to the body and then
relaxing, attending, letting it go. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">It’s very, very simple but very
freeing. It’s liberating not to be trapped in the stories. The
feelings and stories start to cascade. Simplify, coming back to the
bodily sensation, the feeling in the body. The breath is that anchor.
The in-breath: soothing, nurturing, warming, energizing. The
out-breath: releasing, relaxing, expanding. We can tap into that
feeling and allow the moods and impressions to dissipate, grounded in
awareness in the present moment. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Sometimes we have to deal with
physical pain and mental distress. Those are very real experiences.
But we still have the breath, which is always neutral. The breath is
a neutral base to return to. Can we relax around the physical pain
we’re experiencing? Are we exacerbating it? Maybe there’s
illness. Can we actually do anything about it? </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Within that sphere of awareness and
the neutral quality of the breath, we can be present with that pain.
Then, if something needs to be done, we can do it. If not, then we
can establish the attitude of not complicating the pain. Sometimes
the physical pain can be quite bearable, more so than the mental pain
of: “I don’t like it. I don’t want to be here. It shouldn’t
be this way. Why me?” We spin ourselves out like that and that’s
where a lot of pain really is. The actual physical pain is then much
more bearable. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Separate these different
experiences out. This separation isn’t just an intellectual
analysis. On an experiential level, by having the anchor of the
breath coming in and going out, being grounded, relaxed, and settled
in the body, we are able to use discernment. The word that is usually
translated as “wisdom” in Buddhism, </font><font face="Gentium Basic, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>paññā</i></font></font><font face="Gentium Basic, serif">,
is probably translated better as “discernment.” Use that ability
to discern and ask: What’s useful and what’s not useful right
now? What is going to lead to peace? What is going to lead to
agitation? We need to be able to discern. Looking and seeing, we are
able to recognize that yes, this is the course of action to follow. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Mindfulness of breathing and of the
body are anchors for our practice and for the cultivation of
loving-kindness. The ability to be present with one in-breath and one
out-breath is a tremendous kindness to oneself. The ability to be
with the body, to be non-reactive, non-judgmental: that’s an act of
kindness in the present moment. Being very attentive lays the
foundations for the quality of loving-kindness that plays itself out
and is manifested in our actions. </font>

Sariputta goes to pay respects to the Buddha. He asks to take leave
to go wandering on a journey, and the Buddha gives his permission. He
goes to prepare himself to leave. Then another monk, who has a grudge
against Sariputta, goes to the Buddha. He says, “Sariputta hit me
and left the monastery.” The Buddha sends word to one of the other
monks asking him to bring Sariputta, as there is an accusation
against him. The way the Buddha dealt with such issues is interesting
in itself. He didn’t just dismiss the monk saying, “Sariputta
wouldn’t do that.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Sariputta is brought back. The
Buddha explains the accusation. Sariputta’s reply is very moving.
He says, “Having developed mindfulness of the body for so long, it
is impossible to engage in unskillful action. The mind is well
established in loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, measureless,
without enmity and ill will.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Sariputta then gives all sorts of
illustrations of the different ways that he has contemplated and
developed mindfulness of the body, with the effect that the mind is
always in a place of awareness and well-wishing, of compassion
towards all beings, making it impossible to have harmed anybody.
Sariputta was extraordinarily skilled in giving illustrations and
teachings. Finally, the monk who had made the accusation gets up and
says, “I’m sorry. I’ve been foolish and have made a false
accusation against Sariputta. May he forgive me.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">The Buddha’s response is, “Yes,
you have been foolish and you have made a false accusation but,
having recognized your faults and wanting to make amends, you can
grow in the Dhamma and discipline.” Then he turns to Sariputta and
says, “Sariputta, forgive this foolish man before his head splits
in seven pieces.” Sariputta says, “I certainly forgive him and
may he forgive me for anything I have done.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">I thought it was interesting how
Sariputta’s immediate response was: “Somebody who has cultivated
mindfulness of the body for as long as I have, and is so grounded in
it, couldn’t possibly give rise to unwholesome states and is well
established in the quality of loving-kindness and compassion.” </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">These are some reflections on
mindfulness of the body and establishing a base. Perhaps we could go
and do some walking meditation and then come back for a sitting. Of
course, walking meditation is not any different than sitting, in the
sense that when you’re sitting, you’re watching your breath and,
when you’re doing walking meditation, you’re still paying
attention to the whole body, but the primary focus is on the rhythm
of the steps. You’re pacing, walking a bit more slowly than normal
or using whatever pace feels comfortable for establishing
mindfulness. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Pay attention to that sensation of
the right foot touching, rising, moving, and of setting that foot
down. Left foot coming up, moving, setting down. Simply pace, paying
attention to the rhythm of the walking, the sensation of touching the
ground, the movement of the foot, and then the whole body. What’s
your posture like? </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">Again, it’s not merely
disembodied feet touching the pavement. It’s the whole body
connecting with the rhythm of the walking and paying attention to the
posture. Holding your hands clasped, usually in front—it could be
in back, but usually in front is a bit more comfortable—so that
there is a composure to the posture. Keep your eyes downcast so that
your gaze is about six feet in front. About twenty, twenty-five,
thirty paces is appropriate, whatever is comfortable. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Gentium Basic, serif">When you get to the end of the path
and turn around, it’s helpful to stop for a minute, to check and
see: Am I here? Am I still present? Am I still with the walking? Then
continue the walking. At the end of the path, stop for a minute
because it’s easy when the body is walking for the mind to wander
off as well. So connect with present reality, make sure you are
sustaining that connection with the posture and the continuity of
mindfulness.</font></p>
