<h1 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers</h1>
<p>Let’s begin the question-and-answer session. It looks like there is a veritable blizzard of questions. That’s always encouraging.</p>
<p>Question: Can you speak a little bit about <em>samatha-vipassanā</em> and explain the difference between serenity and equanimity?</p>
<p>Answer: <em>Samatha-vipassanā</em> is actually a commentarial division. <em>Samatha</em> is about tranquility, <em>vipassanā</em> about insight. This has a scriptural basis to a certain extent, but as the commentaries tried to systematize the teachings and methodologies, there was a division into distinct realms and separate practices. Samatha includes concentration and tranquility practices. Vipassanā practices are insight techniques.</p>
<p>I tend to lean much more towards the earliest tradition. The Buddha himself didn’t draw huge distinctions between the two. Also, my teacher, Ajahn Chah, didn’t teach in a way that drew large distinctions between them. Oftentimes he said, “Samatha-vipassanā is kind of like a green mango and a ripe mango. Same mango, but it’s a part of the process of ripening.”</p>
<p>The aspects of concentration—settling the mind, unification, creating tranquility—are part of the same process of ripening. The reflective, investigative, contemplative aspects of the practice are part of the same spectrum of practice and training. They depend on each other. A proficiency in both of these aspects of training is required for the mind, the heart, to ripen in relinquishment and liberation.</p>
<p>There is a difference between serenity and equanimity. Serenity is often used as a translation for samatha (tranquility or peaceful abiding of the mind). This is more the result of a concentration and focusing practice.</p>
<p>Equanimity is a bit more nuanced in the sense that it is, first, a brahmavihāra, part of the spectrum of loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. These are sublime, lofty states of mind that result in a very refined state of consciousness. Equanimity is also an enlightenment factor. The seven factors of enlightenment taught by the Buddha are mindfulness, reflection on dhamma, effort, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity. Equanimity is also a factor of wisdom in the sense of the mind becoming very stable, steady, and unshakeable because of an abiding involving both emotion and wisdom. So equanimity is a bit more nuanced. Samatha is just the settling of the mind, the peacefulness of the mind, a peaceful abiding.</p>
<p>Q: Could you please explain the death process? What happens to us as we die or as the body dies? How quickly does rebirth occur? Is there anything in those last moments of that life that affects how we are reborn: our thoughts, our environment, how we are being cared for, our mature or not-so mature emotions, and so forth?</p>
<p>A: One of the things that is good to take into account is that when we think about the death process, we often think, “There I am, in my bed at home, surrounded by my family and loved ones, and then I mindfully pay attention to the death process.” In reality, more often what happens is unpredictable, such as driving down the road at night, all of a sudden there are headlights coming straight at you, and it’s, “Oh, shit!” That’s the death process. Or it’s completely out of your control: you are carted off to the hospital for some reason or other, they fill you full of tubes, and then you are wondering, “Well, this isn’t how I wanted it.”</p>
<p>We idealize how we think we are going to die. Death can come quickly, come slowly, it can come on our terms, it can come not on our terms at all—more often than not, that is what happens. So, the preparation for death is reflection and investigation on a day-to-day basis. One of the chants in the chanting book is called <em>abhiṇha-paccavekkhana</em>: things that are to be reflected upon again and again. The Buddha said we should be reflecting on these on a daily basis.</p>
<p>“I am of the nature to age; I have not gone beyond aging. I am of the nature to sicken; I have not gone beyond sickness. I am of the nature to die; I have not gone beyond dying. All that is mine, beloved, and pleasing, will become otherwise, will become separated from me. I am the owner of my <em>kamma</em>, heir to my <em>kamma</em>, born of my <em>kamma</em>, related to my <em>kamma</em>, abide supported by my <em>kamma</em>. Whatever <em>kamma</em> I shall do, for good or for ill, of that I will be the heir.”</p>
<p>The reflections on aging, sickness, death, impermanence, separation, and being the owner of our <em>kamma</em> are preparation for the death process. It is exceedingly important to challenge our perceptions, illusions of control, and the assumptions about how long we are going to live. If we’ve been practicing for a bit, we usually get it that we have to die at some point in time, but it’s usually “off in the future.” There are so many different ways of dying.</p>
<p>What happens to us as we die? As we die, there is a breakdown of the physical body, of the processes that sustain life, and on a certain level, of the mind itself. Not in the sense of “we all fall apart and go bonkers,” but there is the breakdown of what we conceive of as “my mind and my thoughts.” We prop that up through our whole life and identify with the thoughts, memories, and perceptions. That starts to unravel.</p>
<p>If what you have done is spend your life identifying with thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and memories, then it’s going to be confusing because it’s just natural that these unravel. Reflections in the morning chanting include, “The body is impermanent, feelings are impermanent, perceptions are impermanent, mental formations are impermanent, consciousness is impermanent; the body is not self, feelings are not self, perceptions are not self, mental formations are not self, consciousness is not self.” These are extraordinarily important reflections to investigate and to take on board, so that you are not identifying with and building your home in these impermanent, not-self phenomena, as is the habit of human beings.</p>
<p>Rebirth generally takes place fairly quickly. The Theravadin doctrine is that it’s an instantaneous rebirth. Doctrinal positions were generated historically after the Buddha passed away. The various schools of Buddhism, such as the Theravadins, had particular positions that they took, and one of them was this instantaneous rebirth. There is some scriptural basis for that, but I think one of the wonderful things about Theravadin scriptures is that they kept everything. As the name itself, “the way of the elders,” indicates, they tried to keep everything. They were the conservative element.</p>
<p>So within the scriptures, you can also have things that contradict that. The <em>antarābhava</em>, the in-between becoming, is a state the Buddha talked about. There is also a discourse in which the Buddha compared the state to a fire being blown by the wind. The wind picks up the flame and pushes it somewhere else, which could be near or far away. The Buddha compared that to the desire, the degree of <em>taṇhā</em> and identification, that impels the mind to rebirth.</p>
<p>In general, I don’t think it’s as neat and tidy as the ancient Theravadins put it, instantaneous rebirth, or as neat and tidy as the Tibetans put it, at forty-nine days, or that it’s like this, this, or this. I don’t think anything is neat and tidy. But there are these processes by which rebirth is generated. Rebirth is generated by identification, attachment, state of mind, and the degree of clarity and calmness within the mind.</p>
<p>That is why within Thai tradition, there is emphasis on people attending to a person who is dying: supporting them, making sure they’re comfortable and feeling a sense of ease, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Trying to remind them by chanting, speaking to them, meditating around them, spreading loving-kindness around the sick bed—these are very supportive ways of creating a wholesome mental state. It does have an effect when the mind is in a wholesome state and is clear.</p>
<p>Those transitions are also a time of opportunity as well, of very deep letting go. “Right, I’ve heard this. ‘I am of the nature to die.’ I’ve heard this before.” The important thing is then being able to turn to relinquishment from a place of calm. It’s possible. That is why the support is there and is culturally encouraged.</p>
<p>In all cultures, there tends to be a washing of the body, a ritual both for the people who are alive and for the person who has died so that they can make the transition with peace and relinquishment. This is important.</p>
<p>There are also those who have built up unskillful habits over a lifetime. One of Ajahn Chah’s former monks asked him about working with death and dying, and working with people like that to give them the opportunity for a wholesome rebirth. Ajahn Chah had his cane beside him and, poked the former monk in the chest, knocked him over, pushed him on the ground and said, “<em>buddho, buddho</em>.” Ajahn Chah was saying that the time of death can be painful and very difficult, and if somebody hasn’t done the work beforehand, it’s not that easy. So it’s important to prepare throughout our lives. His Holiness the Dalai Lama was once asked what the basis of his spiritual practice was, and he said, “I practice dying.”</p>
<p>Q: As a guilt-ridden American, I can’t quite comprehend how to respond without guilt when I have caused harm, even inadvertently. Could you walk through the non-guilt-oriented mental process of a person who has harmed or caused inconvenience to someone else? I’m thinking of the monk who falsely accused Sāriputta. If that were me, I would practically have to leave the sangha out of embarrassment and shame.</p>
<p>A: It’s essentially answered in the way the Buddha responded when the monk made his confession—“I falsely accused Sāriputta”—and then asked for forgiveness. The Buddha said, “It’s recognizing one’s faults as faults, one’s unskillful action as unskillful action and wishing to make amends: that is growth in the Noble One’s discipline.” That in itself is the difference. Recognizing that we all make mistakes, whether it’s intentionally or unintentionally, we have the opportunity to reestablish ourselves in that which is skillful, appropriate, in accordance with truth.</p>
<p>Nobody is exempt. Remorse, from a Buddhist perspective, says, “I really missed my shot on that and that was unskillful,” and there is an impetus to change. In Pali there is the word <em>hiri-ottappa</em>: <em>hiri</em> is a sense of conscience or embarrassment toward an action done in the past; <em>ottappa</em> is a concern for future wrong-doing. It’s interesting when you say it in English because early translators used shame and fear of wrongdoing, and what comes up in our minds is that these are heavy, negative states, whereas in the Pali language, these are actually wholesome mental states in the way that mental states are categorized.</p>
<p>In Pali it’s called <em>kusala</em>. Intrinsic to <em>kusala</em> or a wholesome mental state is a sense of well-being, clarity, and discernment. It’s having the clarity to recognize, “That is really unbecoming and not in accord with how I really want to be, so it would be better for me to step back from that,” rather than, “Oh, my god, I did this and what are people going to think of me? I can’t show my face around here anymore.” That spins around “me”: me and the problems I’ve created; me and my awfulness. That in itself is the problem.</p>
<p>The recognition of that which is unskillful has a very wholesome, protective quality. Also, in the Pali language, when that quality of conscience or concern toward wrongdoing is described, the underlying state of the mind regarding hiri is one of respect for ourselves, in the sense that we do not want to do something that would be inappropriate or not in accord with our values and deepest intentions. Ottappa arises out of respect for others because we recognize that as human beings, we’re in the same boat of being subject to birth-aging-sickness-death. We have a mixture of wholesome and unwholesome qualities. There is a fundamental respect for other beings and therefore, we don’t want to harm anybody else either. Both qualities are underpinned by an underlying respect.</p>
<p>The quality of guilt does not give oneself due respect. It undermines our own wholesome qualities. It’s really interesting to reflect on the Buddha’s statement that the recognition of our unskillful actions is a sign of growth in the Noble One’s teaching and training. It’s the actions that speak louder than the perception of individuality.</p>
<p>That’s what tends to govern our sense of who we are: the perception of individuality rather than a recollection of the intentions and actions that we rely on. What do we do on a habitual basis? How do we make our decisions? There are very few Buddhist meditators whose lives are committed to stealing, dishonesty, harming, and violence; it’s pretty rare. But the perception is not in accord with the real actions; rather, the perception is often driven by guilt.</p>
<p>So it’s important to be able to separate that out, to say, “Well actually, I’m committed to integrity, to that which is good. I’m going to shrink back from things that are unskillful.” Also, anybody can make a mistake and miss their shot. A person has the opportunity to recognize that and reestablish him or herself in what is skillful.</p>
<p>There are several occasions in the scriptures where we might think that the Buddha really messed up. It doesn’t come across that the Buddha was agonized with guilt and struggling. It’s more like, “That didn’t work! I’ll try it this way instead.” One of the things that is very helpful to do when recognizing that we have missed our shot is asking for forgiveness and seeking reconciliation. It’s not that difficult to do, and it’s very healing.</p>
<p>Q: How would you describe the <em>jhāna</em> states, and do you teach this kind of meditation?</p>
<p>A: That’s pretty extensive. The <em>jhāna</em> states are internal states of stability and composure that are a basis for very bright states of consciousness. These are states the Buddha encourages because they lead to an energizing and a clarity of the mind that allows seeing things in their true nature. They are a very skillful tool.</p>
<p>I tend to follow Ajahn Chah’s way of teaching. Ajahn Chah would describe the jhāna states as a process of letting go. To the extent that you are willing to let go, the mind settles very stably and steadily. I think that is very helpful because oftentimes there can be a tremendous amount of desire generated for attaining the jhānas and comparing yourself to those who do attain the jhānas. Maybe you do attain the jhānas, but then further comparing occurs; it goes on and on. Recognize that the refined states of consciousness are most easily approached and accessed when we are able to keep letting go of those aspects of the mind that are obstructive. As we keep doing that, the mind settles.</p>
<p>Q: When there is a lot of pain in the body, it is difficult to maintain right effort. Yet sometimes, through patient endurance, the pain lessens. Can you speak about right effort and the connection between right effort and <em>samādhi</em>?</p>
<p>A: It’s good to refresh our memory as to what right effort actually is. When we conceive of right effort, we use the word “effort,” and of course effort is about doing, struggling: getting out there and energetically being assiduous and diligent, which is sometimes good.</p>
<p>But the way the Buddha defines right effort is effort for decreasing unwholesome mental states that have arisen. Effort for the preventing of unwholesome mental states that have yet to arise is also right effort. Effort for the bringing into being of wholesome states that have not yet arisen is right effort. And effort for the maintaining of wholesome states that have arisen is right effort.</p>
<p>It might sound a bit convoluted, but it’s a very clear description, once you get your mind around it. When the Buddha defines it, it’s all about actual mental states. right effort is not about how diligent we appear externally or how much we flog ourselves. It’s about attending to the quality of the mind—wholesome or unwholesome—and how we relate to the unwholesome or unskillful states: whether we support them, buy into them, or exacerbate them, at the expense of undermining the wholesome.</p>
<p>Similarly with wholesome states: how do we encourage those wholesome mental states, those bright states of mind? How do we maintain them, without clamping down, shutting down, or worrying? That worrying is in itself an unwholesome mental state.</p>
<p>In dealing with pain, it’s helpful to pay attention and see the difference between the physical sensation and the mental elaborations around the pain. The physical sensation of pain is oftentimes telling us something like, “I’m tired. I want out of here.” Something is stressed and pain is a warning, trying to get our attention. There are many levels to the physical side: some of it is bearable; some of it may not be necessary to bear and needs to be adjusted, dealt with, or ameliorated in some way.</p>
<p>On the mental level, what is the reaction, what is being added, what is the level of fear or aversion? Pain can be very threatening. It can also be very useful. It definitely gets our attention. There is an immediacy there, so we can even use pain to challenge the mind and the assumptions that we have, bringing a certain urgency to practice.</p>
<p>There’s no single response. We need to be balanced. We need to see what is a genuine call of distress that needs to be heeded and what we can just be patient with, bearing with the pain and directing attention to the mind itself. Sometimes with pain we can simply direct attention to the physical sensation of the pain. Sometimes we can absorb into the pain and the mind can be very, very peaceful. We can be inside the sensation and find that the mind becomes very cool and bright.</p>
<p>There are many ways of responding. It’s a very interesting aspect of the practice. Having physical bodies, we are always going to experience some sort of pain. We can learn a lot about how much we expect, how much we push, or how much we worry or fear, through seeing our reactions to pain. It’s something that is very natural. Having pain is a natural part of the human condition, and it’s important to learn how to deal with it skillfully.</p>
<p>I think one of the main things is gaining confidence that pain can be worked with and that there is a point at which the appropriate way of working with it is to back off, rest, or do something about it. At other times, we can just go into the pain. For many years of my early monastic life, pain, illness, and injury were fairly constant features of my meditation. I had the opportunity and had to use it. I had to become familiar with pain, and I find that that has held me in good stead.</p>
<p>Q: What is loving-kindness? What is the body and mind’s experience when I feel mettā for myself and others?</p>
<p>A: I think everybody is going to experience it in a slightly different way. There is not a formulaic way that you should experience loving-kindness. There is a general parameter at the base of loving-kindness, which is dwelling in non-aversion, to put it in negative terms.</p>
<p>Oftentimes Western culture casts things in idealistic ways. We are very good at ideals: ideally, what would be the perfect expression of loving-kindness? That’s what we try to get, and we can drive ourselves nuts doing this.</p>
<p>I think it’s helpful to begin with a less idealistic basis: dwelling in non-aversion. It’s the absence of aversion, of ill will. Recognizing that, we have something fairly tangible to work with. There is an experience and a recognition because we don’t dwell in aversion all the time, do we? We don’t spend our whole lives in ill will and grumpiness towards the whole world.</p>
<p>We then build on that in a more positive sense. When it’s translated into the Thai language, it is expressed as a well-wishing, wishing oneself and others well. There is a recognition of what we would appreciate, of what others would appreciate: that sense of well-being. I think that is a very useful perception of loving-kindness.</p>
<p>Sometimes the English language is loaded with our cultural baggage: “How can I be loving towards myself and all living beings? I don't love everybody.” Well, sometimes you don’t even like them, but you can wish them well. You can establish that wish for your own well-being and for others’ well-being. You don’t even have to like people to do that. I think that is casting it into a light that is practical and realistic.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s good to use words that are unfamiliar to us. Bhante Guṇaratana plays with language: loving friendliness or an appreciative friendliness. It’s not a word that we use all the time, but it’s trying to convey a particular feeling. That kind of well-wishing or appreciative friendliness is the mental state. Internally, within the mind, there is a warmth, spaciousness, non-contention, a concern for others’ well-being.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there will be a physical relaxation. Aversion, ill will, contention—these have their attendant feelings of agitation and tightening within the body. Physically, with loving-kindness, we will feel a sense of ease, spaciousness, and settledness. Within the heart there will be a similar sense of openness. There will be space for yourself and for others.</p>
<p>So these are some reflections. I enjoy the questions. I never quite know what is going to come out when people present a question. It’s interesting to me as well.</p>
