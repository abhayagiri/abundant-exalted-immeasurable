<p>So, we’ll begin this evening’s question period. Nature abhors a vacuum and we managed to get through all the submitted questions last night. The basket is full again, which is a good sign.</p>
<p>Question: One of my lay insight meditation teachers said, “The Western lay practitioner is an experiment in Buddhism.” What do you think? To me it seems our lay teachers are also an experiment.</p>
<p>Answer: There seems to be some bias there. Certainly, in the West so far, the predominant mode is lay practice and lay teachers. Although there’s an increasing amount of interest in people wanting to study with monastic teachers, and there’s certainly a strong interest in monastic training, the monastic presence is still pretty tiny, really.</p>
<p>At Abhayagiri, we almost always have a waiting list for people who want to come and train.</p>
<p>The classic model is for the monastic sangha to be laying the foundation for teaching, leadership and being an example. I think oftentimes there is a false dichotomy perceived, from the West, because the monastic presence is so strong in Asia. Oftentimes, people overlook the strength of the tradition of lay practice and lay teachers in Asia. Certainly in Thailand, that is very much the case. There are laymen and women who are excellent scholars, teachers. It’s not as monochromatic as people perceive.</p>
<p>Look at the model that the Buddha himself gave. There’s a very interesting discourse where Māra comes, right after the Buddha is enlightened, and says, “You’ve done your work; it's time to pack it in. You can die now.” And the Buddha says, “It is my function and purpose to teach and I won’t pass away until the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen are well established in the path and the fruits, able to give leadership and solve problems, able to stand on their own, so this Dhamma and Discipline can last for a long time.” That was the Buddha’s standard of what was a balanced, strong dispensation: when monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen were all knowledgeable and well-practiced (D 16).</p>
<p>Q: This is a common scenario: I’m caught in a story of praise and blame. I notice a voice says, “That was very quick. You’re getting good at this.” I wake up again. “Ah, I know you, Māra.” A voice says, “Excellent, what a skillful yogi you’re becoming.” Māra seems to co-opt every moment of awakening to feed the ego. Do I patiently endure, and this will dissipate with time and practice, or is there something you can suggest?</p>
<p>A: Well, it’s both, in the sense that it’s really hard to overestimate how important patient endurance is to the practice – the willingness to bear with the pathetic nature of the mind. But then there are also those experiments, those reflections we use in undermining the perceptions of self and ego – the recollection of impermanence, uncertainty, and change. “These are mental states arising and ceasing.” That’s tuning into it as <em>dhammas</em> arising and ceasing, as opposed to me struggling with Māra, me being the champion over Māra, me being defeated by Māra again: that “me and Māra” story.</p>
<p>So, seeing <em>dhammas</em> arising and ceasing, that’s all that is needed. There isn’t a “me” in that. It’s a really important aspect of insight to be turning attention towards. Also, we can develop the deconstructing of the process of how thoughts arise and cease: getting to know the sense of feeling, perception, mental formation, consciousness, desire, attachment, and clinging, the process of Dependent Origination –“It’s just these five khandhas that are arising and ceasing”– and being able to rest in the awareness of those five khandhas, as opposed to buying into the story of “me and my khandhas.”</p>
<p>Q: The loving-kindness chant includes “May I abide in freedom from affliction.” Why is affliction not included in the wish for all beings, while hostility, ill-will and anxiety are in both?</p>
<p>A: The reason is because in that chant it’s actually just a little bit further down. I can’t remember how it’s translated, but that particular chant is the chant for all the brahmavihāras: loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. The wish “May all beings be free from affliction” is an expression of compassion and is actually worded, “May all beings be released from all suffering.” That is how it is expressed, because that is the fundamental expression of compassion. The loving-kindness aspiration is the wish for happiness and well-being and the expression of compassion is the wish for freedom from suffering. For some reason, in that chant, it is folded in with loving-kindness. Sometimes it’s difficult to find a hard and fast distinction between the two. In order to experience well-being, then of course one needs to be free from suffering.</p>
<p>Q: This morning you spoke about bringing to mind the mettā-nimitta, the mettā-object. I have some understanding of the feeling of mettā, but no understanding of the mettā-nimitta. Could you explain more fully?</p>
<p>A: It’s exactly the same. <em>Nimitta</em> is more a generic term for the object. We often associate <em>nimitta</em> with some type of light or image. With mindfulness of breathing and concentration, there would be encouragement to develop a sign of light or imagery. But the actual word <em>nimitta</em> just means sign. So the sign of metta is the feeling, the actual feeling, emotion within the heart, within experience. That is the nimitta.</p>
<p>It is important to attend to that. If one is looking for something else, or just repeating the phrases, thinking, “This is the mettā-nimitta,” or trying to conjure up an image of oneself being suffused with loving-kindness somehow, one can get off track. The feeling itself is the sign, the tangible object that is the basis for unification, which one is able to absorb into. As one experiences and nurtures that, one can allow the mind to unify with the feeling, and that’s how it expands and stabilizes.</p>
<p>Q: Can you speak about working with fear and loss of ego identity, fear and death?</p>
<p>A: That’s one of the places where loving-kindness is a very skillful meditation and exercise, because that sense of fear easily comes up with the loss of the familiar, with the uncertainty of where to place one’s attention. What can one trust as one starts to see? Body: can’t rely on that. Feelings, perceptions, thoughts: completely untrustworthy. Consciousness: not a good deal. You look at the world around and ...</p>
<p>So it’s easy to be shaken by the instability and uncertainty of everything, and there can be a fear there, uncertainty, a certain confusion and discombobulation. It’s good to be able to recognize that, even if our experience is completely uncertain and unstable, “This particular feeling of loving-kindness is trustworthy. I’ve experienced that. I’ve seen that. That’s a true feeling within the heart.”</p>
<p>There is also the confidence that arises just in virtue, all the things that the Buddha encourages. There isn’t anything that the Buddha encourages that is something to be looked on askance, as if it were untrustworthy.</p>
<p>On a certain level when one first approaches the teachings, like in the morning chanting: Birth is dukkha, ageing is dukkha, sickness is dukkha, death is dukkha, separation is dukkha, association is dukkha: everything’s dukkha. One can think, “Wow, this is a miserable teaching.”</p>
<p>But then when one investigates: “Well, what does the Buddha actually encourage you to do? What does he lay out as a path of practice and training?” The Noble Eightfold Path. Right view, right intention: association with wisdom. Right speech, right action, right livelihood: virtue. Right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration: peaceful, tranquil states of mind. Well, it’s all good. The path is completely associated with the wholesome, the skillful, the uplifting.</p>
<p>Then there are other spiritual attributes we can trust, say, the qualities that are conducive to passing over, transcending, crossing over suffering: the <em>pāramīs</em>. Generosity, virtue, renunciation, patience, effort, resolution, truthfulness, loving-kindness, equanimity, wisdom: everything that one could conceive of that is really good. That’s what the Buddha encourages and that’s what forms the basis for the ability to cross over suffering. The heart is replete with well-being and stability. Recollecting and reminding oneself of what the Buddha encourages us to cultivate and develop: those are all exceedingly beneficial, bright states of mind.</p>
<p>When aspects of fear come up, it’s helpful to be able to recognize where they come from. Of course, they come from identification with self, identification with ego, identification with body, identification with mind, identification with the world and all the things that we have pretty much no control over. So when one looks at it quite clearly, one realizes, “Well, I really have very little control.” It’s a very practical teaching to allow us to approach this. It’s quite natural in the human condition to be dismayed at the loss of, the threat to self and ego.</p>
<p>There’s a wonderful quote by Ajahn Mahā Boowa, speaking about Ajahn Mun. Ajahn Mun once taught, “Normally, as human beings, we respond to teachings on liberation and nibbāna with a curious sense of fear and trepidation. I don’t want to go there. I don’t want to do that. There’s nothing there. Our parents and grandparents have all taught us quite well to attach to family, attach to possessions, and attach to position.” That’s our conditioning. As the conditioning changes, inevitably there is a shift that takes place, and I think it is important to recollect what the Buddha actually encourages us to do. This is good stuff.</p>
<p>Q: I’m not sure within the context of this retreat when to be resting simply with the four foundations of mindfulness, and when to be reciting mettā phrases. Can you please advise as to how and when to move skillfully from one practice to the other?</p>
<p>A: Within the context of how I’ve been presenting what is “billed” as a mettā retreat, there is a recognition of how mettā is a part of a spectrum of practices that are the Buddha’s teachings. Certainly the four foundations of mindfulness are an overarching framework to attend to.</p>
<p>There’s a discourse (M 19) where the Buddha talks about establishing mindfulness on particular skillful, wholesome thoughts and being able to hold that exclusively for a day, or a night, or a day and a night: establishing the mind in that, discerning what’s skillful and unskillful, and then committing to the wholesome thoughts. But then the mind gets tired, so then it’s necessary to return to a place of stillness or stability.</p>
<p>One has to recognize clearly and engage skillfully in the recitation of the mettā phrases. It’s using a thought process, and, by its very nature, it’s easy for it to become repetitious and feel tiring to the mind. Again, it’s important to recognize that the recitation of those phrases is to be used as a recollection and a reminder of the actual feeling. As one establishes that feeling, which is non-discursive, the mind can stay with that. But the recitation is a helpful tool to keep the mind within the bounds of mettā, the loving-kindness perception.</p>
<p>But if one is continuing to do that and the feeling is not strong enough to enable one to rest in it in a non-discursive way, then it’s important to rest the mind on an object within the four foundations of mindfulness – body, feeling, mind, and objects of mind – in some way. Of course, the body is an immediate non-discursive object that the mind can rest in, relax in, bringing a settling quality throughout the body and mind. When the mind is refreshed, then it can go back to the recitation to keep developing and stabilizing the perception of the feeling. So, one can work with them back and forth. There’s no hard and fast rule. It’s more: What is the result? What is the state of the mind? What is going to be useful for settling and stilling?</p>
<p>Q: It seems that mettā would be much easier without a self to protect. How does one realize anattā?</p>
<p>A: That’s an excellent question, in the sense that, as an insight, one starts by realizing that the obstruction to mettā is actually not anger and ill-will, but the sense of self. That’s the big obstruction, and as we reflect, investigate and start having a clear insight into the nature of Dhamma, the nature of the teachings and what the Buddha is giving us as an opportunity for liberation, then loving-kindness is a natural expression of that not-self aspect of the Dhamma. Yes, the cultivation of mettā would be a lot easier without the perception of self.</p>
<p>Q: What is <em>upekkhā</em>, equanimity, and how does one practice it?</p>
<p>A: Upekkhā is equanimity and evenness of the mind, the mind being in perfect balance, a sense of recognition of the nature of <em>kamma</em>. The practice and basis of equanimity is traditionally described as understanding the nature of <em>kamma</em>. The chants we do say: “All beings are the owners of their <em>kamma</em>, heir to their <em>kamma</em>, born of their <em>kamma</em>, related to their <em>kamma</em>, abide supported by their <em>kamma</em>. Whatever <em>kamma</em> they shall do, for good or for ill, of that they will be the heir.” The sense of equanimity is being able to recognize that whatever anybody is experiencing is because of causes and conditions that have been laid down.</p>
<p>The stain or “near enemy” of equanimity is indifference. Equanimity is the ability to be very steady and clear, and be in a place of equipoise and balance. One recognizes that the way things work is through causes and conditions, and there’s not a “self” involved in it, there’s not an individual, it’s merely collections of causes and conditions.</p>
<p>Our habit of mind is to go to this person, that individual, that personality, our preferences, our likes and our dislikes. But stepping back to a place of equanimity is being able to see these causes and conditions, so one is not shaken by anything. But it is important to recognize that indifference is not equanimity.</p>
<p>Also, the brahmavihāras are not separate, individual things, like you only have equanimity because you’ve given up on loving-kindness, compassion, and sympathetic joy. Because loving-kindness and compassion are exceedingly strong and stable, one has increased understanding and insight, so that one is able to rest in a place of complete stability and not be shaken by anything, because one sees that the nature of all things is to arise through causes and conditions.</p>
<p>The reflection on <em>kamma</em> is that all beings inherit the results of their <em>kamma</em>. There’s not a personality, a “me” or “mine.” It’s not fixed. It isn’t as if something happens and then that inevitable, immutable state of being is going to exist forever. Everything is in a state of change. Patterns and circumstances can all change. As one recognizes that and has a much clearer insight into the nature of what causes and conditions are functioning, then one has an opportunity to put attention onto the place where it is going to make the most difference.</p>
<p>Q: What is the most fun part about being a monk?</p>
<p>A: I can assure you it’s not fun. It’s like eating and sleeping. It’s very ordinary. Probably in terms of the most delight or joy that comes is the opportunity to meet really accomplished and pure beings. Fun for a monk is the opportunity to draw close to people and to serve them, or to be in situations where one has contact. You get to meet some exceptional beings.</p>
<p>Q: What does “the four pairs, the eight kinds of noble beings,” in the Recollection of the Sangha, mean?</p>
<p>A: It’s a way of classification in terms of entry into realization. There are four stages of realization: steam-entry, once-returner, non-returner, and fully enlightened being, or arahant. <em>Sotāpanna</em>, <em>sakadāgāmi</em>, <em>anāgāmi</em>, arahant. So there’s four.</p>
<p>Then there’s path and fruition. So there are those who are on the path to stream-entry and those who have reached its fruition, those who are on the path to once-returning and those who have reached its fruition, those who are on the path to non-returning and its fruition, and those who are on the path to arahantship and its fruition. Those are the four pairs and eight kinds of noble beings.</p>
<p>In the commentarial tradition, the way they line it up is that the path and fruition are tied to each other. There’s a realization of path, and, within mind-moments, there’s a realization of fruition. There are a few suttas in the Canon, however, that make it clear that, for someone who is on the path, it could be a long period of time, years even, before there is a fruition. To me, that makes sense.</p>
<p>The sutta tradition has a clear description that there are those who have got an insight into what the path is, what the practice is, what the actual goal is, but who are still to have the full realization of that. It could be a very quick insight and realization, or it could take time for that to come to fruition. Those are the four pairs, the eight kinds of noble beings. It <em>is</em> a bit mysterious when we chant it.</p>
<p>Q: When doubt is mentioned under the hindrances, is it mainly referring to doubt about the Buddha’s teachings? Are there other implications?</p>
<p>A: Oftentimes, when one reads the texts and commentaries, inevitably they talk about doubt about the Buddha’s teachings. I and most of the teachers that I know don’t narrow it down that much.</p>
<p>In terms of a hindrance, a <em>nīvaraṇa</em>, a quality of mind that obstructs the fundamental goodness of the mind, then it isn’t just doubt about the Buddha’s teachings. It’s the tendency to doubt, to waver. Of course, when you doubt, waver, are uncertain, then the focus will be on the teachings, but you’ll tend to doubt everything else as well.</p>
<p>So it’s good to get a handle on doubt, uncertainty, wavering: how it plays itself out in day-to-day life. It’s really interesting to watch on a day-to-day basis. How does it play out? “Should I have two of those fruits or should I just have one? It can turn into a moment where everything stops: should I do this or should I do that; go forward or go back?” We start to doubt everything, doubt can creep into everything and then it manifests in the teachings as well: doubting the teachings, doubting the practice, doubting oneself, can one do it, can one not do it, is there any point even to doing this, “I’m not sure that I can do this.” All of it is doubt. So, being able to recognize that it’s doubt, and that’s all it is, one can then go forward.</p>
<p>This is also a situation where mindfulness of the body is really helpful, in the sense that you’re never going to talk yourself into a resolution of doubt through the mind. You’ll never get everything figured out enough not to doubt, if doubt is the underlying, fallback position. Recognize how doubt manifests as a feeling of uncertainty, a feeling of hesitation, a feeling of discomfort around a particular decision or action. Then, by employing mindfulness of the body, you can cut through that and move forward. Sometimes it’s helpful to make a wrong decision and do something, at least not get caught in wavering and uncertainty, just as a part of training. That sense of wanting to be absolutely sure that one is doing something right before doing it paralyzes you and ties you up in knots. So, be willing to cut through that and move forward. One can feel in the body that it is helpful just to move forward, to take action, and not get caught in doubt.</p>
